                    The Detester Team is composed of youth from around the globe. Despite the distance that separates us, we as youth all
                    share the experience of receiving an education. However, in times like these, when a global pandemic by the name of
                    COVID-19 has taken the world by storm, many of our daily activities are modified in hopes of keeping us safe whilst also
                    attempting to maintain a sense of normalcy. The following collection of responses, written by some of the Detester team
                    members, highlights what education looks like for youth in the United States. Visit <a style="text-decoration: underline;" href="https://detester.org/publications/32ALookAtEducationPart1.html">here</a> to read the set of responses
                    about education outside of the United States.

                <p>
                    As soon as there were rumors of lockdown starting in Australia, with
                    a growing number of cases, my university started remote learning
                    only in week 3 of the first semester of the year. The transformation
                    was fairly smooth, and we were given one extra week of holiday to
                    fully accommodate for this transition to online learning. My
                    university has 40,000 students, so in my opinion, they handled it
                    pretty well. Everyone got accustomed to Zoom tutorials pretty
                    quickly and lecture recordings remained the same. Because I am
                    pursuing a Bachelor of Arts degree, all of our assignments are
                    virtual anyway, so there was no dramatic change to this aspect. The
                    main difference is the fact that with tutorials being online, it
                    became almost impossible to make friends in classes. Breakout rooms
                    were extremely awkward, and I now dread being put into a breakout
                    room. Since remote learning has started, I have not made any friends
                    at university, which actually makes me pretty sad because it is my
                    last year of uni and I wanted to be social this year. Furthermore,
                    in my degree, I rely a lot on physical sources like books to do my
                    research for all the essays I have to write, which comprise my main
                    assignments. I felt a bit disadvantaged with fewer sources, but I
                    managed to complete all my research by spending more time online
                    searching for sources. The quality of education hasn’t gone down for
                    me since I don’t have any practical aspects in my course. In fact,
                    my grades actually improved during this semester and my overall
                    average mark increased by quite a bit. Because of remote learning
                    and quarantine, I stayed at home for much longer, and I was able to
                    concentrate better on my work, which resulted in better grades. I’ve
                    also discovered that the teaching staff for my subjects provided us
                    with more support and resources than ever. I’ve had so many
                    consultations during this past year from tutors, who were
                    enthusiastic about helping me with assignments, which I’m beyond
                    grateful for. This whole experience has had its ups and downs, but
                    I’m more or less accustomed to online learning now.
