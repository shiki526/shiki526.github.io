        Yemen: The History of Conflict Behind the World’s Worst Humanitarian
        Crisis

            While news about the COVID-19 pandemic, the vigorous socio-political
            movement against police brutality, and the warfare in Syria and Iraq
            are bombarding the rest of the world, a Middle Eastern country
            silently suffers from what the United Nations coined “the worst
            humanitarian crisis in the world”. Surrounded by wealthy and
            prosperous oil-producing giants of the Arab world, the Republic of
            Yemen – despite being equally abundant in natural resources
            (including oil) – fails to thrive as their neighbors have and
            instead falls into the realm of seemingly interminable warfare,
            uncontrollable outbreaks of disease, and devastating famines. How
            did this Middle Eastern nation – once the “heart of ancient Arabia”
            – fall into such an unstable state? Perhaps we can find the answers
            in the history of the nation's never-ceasing domestic and
            international warfare since its formation in 1990.

          </p>
          <p>
            <span class="italic underline">Location:</span> Yemen is a country
            in the Middle East region that sits on the southwestern tip of the
            Arabian Peninsula. The nation also owns two territories within its
            territorial waters; the volcanic island of Perim (or Mayuun) and the
            archipelago of Socotra.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span class="italic underline">Bordering Countries:</span> Yemen
            shares a 1307 km (~812 miles) border with Saudi Arabia to the north,
            and a 294 km (~182 miles) border with Oman to the east.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span class="italic underline">Maritime Borders:</span> The main
            territory of Yemen is surrounded by three bodies of water – the Gulf
            of Aden to the south, the Arabian Sea to the southeast, and the Red
            Sea to the west. The island of Perim (Mayuun) is located on the
            Strait of Mandeb at the entrance to the Red Sea, and the archipelago
            of Socotra sits on major shipping routes between the Guardafui
            Channel and the Arabian Sea.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span class="italic underline">Environment and Climate:</span> Most
            of Yemen’s central and eastern territory comprises of hot and dry
            desert plains. Thus, the majority of Yemen’s population resides in
            the western region by the coast of the Red Sea, where the climate is
            more temperate. The coast is composed of a narrow strip of plains
            and large areas of rugged hills and mountains. Some of the nation's
            environmental concerns include limited freshwater supply year-round,
            overgrazing, soil erosion, deforestation, and the natural hazards of
            volcanic activities, sandstorms, and monsoons.
          </p>
          <h4>Important Sites</h4>
          <p>
            Sanaʽa is the largest city and the internationally recognized
            capital of Yemen. President Abd Rabbuh Mansur Hadi - of the official
            Yemeni government - briefly removed its status as the capital after
            he fled the city amidst the Yemeni coup d'état in 2015. As a result
            of the rebellion, the city is still controlled by the Houthi rebels
            as of June 2020.
          </p>
          <p>
            Aden is a major port city and the temporary capital of Yemen after
            President Hadi escaped Sanaʽa in 2015. The city was the capital of
            South Yemen - or the People's Democratic Republic of Yemen - before
            the unification and formation of the current Yemen. It is the site
            of many conflicts of the current war, the most notable being the
            Battle of Aden, in which the Houthi rebels fought with President
            Hadi's forces - representing the Yemeni government - for the control
            of the city. The Saudi Arabian Army aided the governmental forces in
            driving out the Houthis, but they ultimately lost control of the
            city to another separatist force – the Southern Transitional Council
            (STC) – in 2018.
          </p>
          <p>
            Sa‘dah (sometimes spelt “Sa‘ada”) is a city that sits high on the
            hot and dry mountains of northwestern Yemen. Being the site of the
            Houthi insurgents’ first revolt – the Battle of Sa‘dah – in 2011,
            the city is often seen as the Houthis’ “homeland”.
          </p>
          <h4>Relevant Terminology</h4>
          <p>
            Sunni (Sunnī in Arabic) is one of the two major branches of Islam,
            the other being Shiʿi. Sunni Muslims, referred to as Sunnis, make up
            the majority – 87 to 90 percent – of all adherents of the religion,
            and therefore often regard their denomination as the larger and
            mainstream branch of the religion. The central split in beliefs
            between the two branches occurs after the death of the Prophet
            Muhammad. The Sunnis recognize all of the first four caliphs as the
            Prophet Muhammad’s rightful successors, whereas the Shiʿah –
            adherents of Shiʿi Islam – believe otherwise. Countries with the
            greatest proportion of Sunnis include Saudi Arabia and Egypt.
          </p>
          <p>
            Shiʿi (Shīʿī in Arabic), sometimes also referred to as Shiʿite, is
            the minority of the two major branches of Islam. In contrast to the
            Sunnis, who believe that all of the first four caliphs are rightful
            successors of the Prophet Muhammad, the Shiʿah or Shia – Shiʿi
            Muslims – firmly hold ʿAlī ibn Abī Ṭālib or ʿAlī, who was the cousin
            and son-in-law of the Prophet, as the sole successor. Countries of
            sizable Shiʿah populations include Iran and Bahrain.

          <p>
            The Arab Spring is a series of related political uprisings in
            several Middle East countries – including Tunisia, Morocco, Syria,
            Libya, Egypt, and Bahrain – to call for pro-democracy changes in
            regimes. The event was sparked by the protest of a Tunisian street
            vendor, who set himself on fire in response to the arbitrary seizing
            of his vegetable stand by police over failure to obtain a permit in
            December of 2010. In the spring of the following year - hence the
            name of the movement - Tunisia became the first country to witness
            the series of political upheaval. However, despite the protests’
            success in removing authoritarian rule in several countries, the
            political unrest also morphed into full-scale civil wars in
            countries like Syria and Yemen.
          </p>
          <h4>Key Parties</h4>
          <span class="italic underline">President Ali Abdullah Saleh</span>
          <p>
            Ali Abdullah Saleh was a member of the Yemeni political party
            General People’s Congress (GPC) and the president of Yemen from 1990
            until February 2012, when he signed an agreement to transfer his
            position with Abdrabbuh Mansour Hadi – who was the then
            vice-president - in exchange for immunity from execution due to
            public outrage. Before becoming the head of state of the unified
            Yemen, Saleh served as the president of North Yemen – or the Yemen
            Arab Republic – since 1978. He had a military background and a
            history of leading a coup d’état against the imamate (a state ruled
            by an imam, an islamic leader position) of North Yemen and
            establishing a civilian government in 1962. By the time of his
            resignation, Saleh had already been in rule for 33 years. He
            famously compared his experience of ruling Yemen to “dancing on the
            heads of snakes”. After his presidency, he continued to be a
            political influencer and allied with the Houthi rebels, who later
            claimed his assassination on December 4, 2017.

          <span class="italic underline">President Abdrabbuh Mansour Hadi</span>
          <p>
            Abdrabbuh Mansour Hadi is a member of the Yemeni political party GPC
            and the internationally recognized president of Yemen since February
            2012. He also had a military background and occupied many field
            positions in the army before 1986, when the party he served – the
            Yemeni Socialist Party – lost the civil war in South Yemen. After
            the loss, Hadi followed the former South Yemeni president into exile
            in North Yemen, where he gained recognition in the new army. His
            military prominence remained when the two Yemeni states united in
            1990. At the beginning of 1994, he was promoted as the Minister of
            Defence by President Saleh for his support during the first Yemeni
            civil war; and by the end of the same year, he further appointed to
            replace the former vice-president, who turned to fight against
            Saleh. In 2012, he was elected as the president of Yemen after
            Saleh’s resignation. However, he soon met his own rebellion forces.
            He fled from the capital city to Aden in 2015 - when the Houthis
            conquered the city - and ultimately went into exile in Saudi Arabia
            after the rebels reached his temporary haven in 2017. Due to the
            ongoing hostility against him, he spends most of his time in Saudi
            Arabia.

          <h4>The Houthis</h4>
          <p>
            The Houthis – more formally known as the Houthi movement or Ansar
            Allah (“Supporters of God”) – is a Yemeni political and armed
            movement that emerged from the city of Sa‘dah in the 1990s under the
            leadership of Zaidi – a minority branch under Shiʿi Islam – leader
            Hussein Badreddin al-Houthi. Their rebellion began with the
            opposition to President Saleh, whom they accused of marginalizing
            them and causing the country's high unemployment rate, economic
            decline, and governmental corruption. There had been numerous armed
            conflicts between the rebels and the Yemeni government forces under
            Saleh. The most notable revolt was during the Arab Spring in 2011,
            which ultimately contributed to Saleh’s resignation in the following
            year. Ironically, the Houthis joined forces with Saleh in 2014 to
            rebel against the current Yemeni leader, President Hadi. The allied
            forces took over Yemen’s capital city, Sanaʽa, which gave them the
            “upper-hand” in the civil war. As of June 2020, the Houthis still
            occupy the capital city and most populated areas in the country.

            >The Southern Transitional Council (STC)</span
          >
          <p>
            The Southern Transitional Council (STC) is a secessionist
            organization in southern Yemen with the goal of separating their
            part of the country from the rest of Yemen – as it was before the
            unification with North Yemen. The separatist force is led by the
            former governor of Aden, who grew resentment towards the Hadi
            government after the president dismissed him in 2017 due to close
            relations with the United Arab Emirates (UAE). In 2018, with the
            support of the UAE, the STC seized the nation’s temporary capital –
            Aden – in a coup d’état. Perhaps due to the increasingly complex
            conflicts of interests and casualties of civilians, the STC signed
            an agreement – the Riyadh Agreement – with the Hadi government in
            2019 to end the power-struggle in southern Yemen. However, recent
            outbreaks of armed conflicts in the south make it doubtable whether
            the separatist force is determined to follow the Saudi-brokered
            agreement.

            The Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) - currently known as the

            Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates (UAE). The
            union’s main objective is to strengthen the bond between the Arab
            nations based on their similar political and cultural identities,
            and through this bond, achieve economic and military stability.

          <h3>The History</h3>
          <p>
            Despite many sources claiming that Yemen’s political unrest began in
            2015 when the Houthis took control of Sanaʽa and Saudi-led forces
            began to intervene – or 2011 when the Arab Spring movement catalyzed
            the current civil war – the truth is that the nation had never been
            stable since its establishment in 1990. In the following section,
            the 30 years of history, the present situation, and the future of
            Yemen are divided into six sections categorized by significant
            events.
          </p>
          <h4>
            The Uneasy Beginning: Unification of North and South Yemen (1990 –
            1999)
          </h4>
          <p>
            May 22, 1990, marked the day North and South Yemen – the Yemen Arab
            Republic and the People’s Republic of South Yemen – united as the
            single nation of the Republic of Yemen. However, accompanying the
            merge was the uneased tension between the two territories, who had
            been periodically at war with each other since 1972. One of the
            differences between the two states was the population, with South
            Yemen comprised mostly of Sunnis and North Yemen majorly of Zaidi
            Shiʿah. The two former countries were also politically diverse, as
            North Yemen had a nationalist government at the time of the merge
            while South Yemen – although going through reforms – was a socialist
            state. Despite the disputes between the two Yemeni states that would
            foreshadow future conflicts, the unification had been relatively
            peaceful, as a unified parliament and constitution were formed and
            agreed upon. The joint Yemeni government consisted of Saleh – the
            former head of North Yemen – as the president and Ali Salim al-Beidh
            – the former leader of South Yemen – as the vice-president. North
            Yemen’s capital city, Sanaʽa, became the capital for the unified
            Yemen.

            However, in just one year after the nation’s establishment, Yemen
            had encountered its first international crisis. As a member of the
            United Nations Security Council (UNSC) for 1990 and 1991, the
            country voted against military intervention in Iraq and Kuwait
            during the Gulf War against the wishes of many Western and Arab
            countries – such as the U.S and Saudi Arabia. As a result, the
            international financial support for Yemen was cut, and neighbouring
            Saudi Arabia expelled around 800,000 Yemeni workers, leading the
            newly formed country into a sharp economic decline. It was also
            during this period of financial difficulty – with hunger and
            widespread unemployment – that opposition forces to the government
            began to emerge.
          </p>
          <p>
            In 1994, as Saleh’s government failed to ease the increasingly
            dreadful economic crisis, vice-president al-Beidh – who was the
            president of former South Yemen – and many southern officials
            organized a rebellion in an attempt to gain independence for the
            south, despite only merging four years ago. Establishing the event
            as Yemen’s first civil war, President Salah declared a state of
            emergency and dismissed al-Beidh as the vice-president. In his place
            – as previously mentioned – was Hadi, the then Minister of Defense.
            The President and his new vice-president succeeded in vanquishing
            the separatist forces and resolving the crisis by the end of 1994.
            The southern succession forces are briefly put to rest.
          </p>
          <h4>Terrorists, Rebels, and Separatists (2000 - 2010)</h4>
          <p>
            In October of 2000, Yemen once again grabbed Western media’s
            headlines for a terrorist attack in the country with the U.S. as the
            target. USS Cole, one of the United States Navy’s guided missile
            destroyer was damaged during a suicide bombing attack claimed by the
            terrorist group al-Qaeda. Seventeen American nationals were killed
            and thirty-nine were injured, making the event the deadliest attack
            against a U.S. navy vessel since 1987.
          </p>
          <p>
            The country was alarmed, and the government began to take action -
            although not after denying and putting off the attack as "an
            accident" until U.S. investigation revealed otherwise. However, no
            significant progress nor response had been made for over a year,
            further decreasing Saleh’s credibility and popularity among the
            citizens. Even his more notable actions, such as expelling more than
            a hundred foreign Islamic clerics in February 2002, had no impact on
            the worsening of terrorism in the area. In fact, merely eight months
            after the expulsion, al-Qaeda launched another attack, killing one
            and injuring twelve crew members on the oil supertanker MV Limburg
            in the Port of Aden.
          </p>
          <p>
            A year before the end of the decade, branches of the terrorist group
            in Saudi Arabia and Yemen merged to form the collective branch
            called al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP). The AQAP would be
            responsible for many notorious attacks in the future, which gave the
            group widespread recognition as the most dangerous branch of
            al-Qaeda.

          <p>
            In addition to combating the terrorist threats, the Yemeni
            government was simultaneously facing a new opposition force emerging
            from the northern mountains of the country. From June to September
            of 2004, the Houthis – a rebel group of Zaidi Shiʿi minorities –
            sparks up conflict with government forces when attempts have been
            made to arrest their leader, Hussein Badreddin al-Houthi. Despite
            the rebellion’s presence since the 1990s, no armed conflicts have
            occurred until President Saleh has accused the group of trying to
            overthrow the government and the republican system to implement
            Zaidi religious law in 2004. The Houthis, in response, have claimed
            that their actions are merely self-defense against governmental
            discrimination on their minority population. Neither party has
            managed to claim their cases and instead fall into months of brutal
            combat.
          </p>
          <p>
            The insurgency has already been disastrous – with hundreds of
            civilian deaths amid the initial conflicts – but the assassination
            of the Houthi leader on September 10 only fueled the rebels’ anger
            further. After losing their leader, the group continued to engage in
            intermittent armed clashes with government forces – notably the
            fight in March 2005, in which two hundred civilians were killed
            within the month. The periodic combats would continue until 2010
            when the movements in demand for the president’s resignation began
            to build momentum. By this brief period of ceasefire, as many as
            80,000 Yemeni civilians were displaced within the country.
          </p>
          <p>
            Meanwhile, frustration towards the nation’s unification rekindled in
            the south, only to be fueled further when the government launched an
            offensive against the separatists in late 2010.
          </p>
          <h4>Hope, Disappointment, and Unceasing Rebellion (2011 - 2014)</h4>
          <p>
            In the spring of 2011, the wave of pro-democracy uprisings against
            authoritarian governments - known as the Arab Spring in retrospect -
            swept through numerous North African and Middle Eastern countries.
            Although the Yemeni version of the movement is lesser-known, it had
            a significant and long-lasting impact on the country’s political and
            societal landscape. Similar to the ones of Tunisians and Egyptians,
            the Yemeni demonstrations started in January of the year with public
            rallies voicing the people’s complaints about the poor economic
            condition, high unemployment rate, unsettled military unrest, and
            the marginalization of minority groups under Saleh's corrupted
            government. By March, the increased conflicts between the government
            and the civilian, rebel, and separatist forces urged the protesters
            to harden their demands for Saleh’s immediate resignation. They had
            achieved this - after a few failed attempts at negotiation and a
            successful physical attack on Saleh - in November of 2011. The
            resignation of the president and the transfer of his power to Hadi -
            the then vice-president - had been overseen and brokered by both
            members of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) and the UN to prevent
            last-minute refusal and disrespect for the agreements.

            The Yemeni people had officially elected Hadi as the president in
            February of 2012. Although, it was unclear whether he gained genuine
            public support as he won as the sole candidate in an election that
            was boycotted by both the Houthis in the north and the secessionists
            in the south.
          </p>
          <p>
            Following the initiatives proposed by the GCC, the new president
            launched a National Dialogue Conference (NDC) in March 2013 to
            discuss major Yemeni constitutional, political, and social issues.
            The conference concluded in the following year with Hadi promising
            to take actions - such as constitutional drafting and holding a
            constitutional referendum - towards transitioning into a more
            democratic government.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, the proposed reforms failed to address many of the
            country’s core problems. For example, the threat of terrorism had
            been growing - with two significantly destructive suicide attacks in
            one year - without constructive and effective actions from the Hadi
            government. Many Yemenis were once hopeful for the change but began
            to show growing disappointment at the lack of improvement. Among
            these people, the Houthis - who remained peaceful until 2014 - grew
            increasingly resentful for the lack of motion addressing their
            grievances. They retook the streets and began another rebellion
            towards the newly-established government. However, this time, their
            revolt was joined by forces loyal to Saleh - the Houthis’ once sworn
            enemies - who saw this as the opportunity to return the former
            president to power. Together, they fought against the federal
            military and conquered the capital city - Sanaʽa - in September
            2014, forcing President Hadi to escape and move his government
            headquarters to Aden, a major southern port city. The presidential
            panel attempted to draft several amendments to accommodate some of
            the rebels' demands, but the offers were rejected and the Yemeni
            civil war began in full force.

          <h4>International Involvement and Proxy War (2015 - 2016)</h4>
          <p>
            After the invasion of Sanaʽa, the Houthis and forces of Saleh
            continued to push south towards President Hadi’s temporary base at
            Aden. They arrived at the port city and took control of the airport
            and the presidential headquarters in February 2015, forcing the
            president to flee to neighbouring Oman then ultimately to Saudi
            Arabia. The war soon developed into a complex international
            crossfire.
          </p>
          <p>
            Despite the casualty rate quickly increasing since the beginning of
            the war in 2014, it did not drastically spike into an alarming
            amount until Saudi Arabia interfered with nine other predominantly
            Muslim countries. The media often refer to this party as the
            “Saudi-led coalition”. The coalition began its campaign of
            relentless airstrikes in 2015 - after being defeated by the rebels
            on land due to unfamiliarity with the landscape. Despite the nation
            claiming to be aiming at military targets, the UN estimated that
            one-third of the aerial attacks were aimed at civilian gatherings
            places and infrastructures - including hospitals, schools, and even
            a funeral. Moreover, the international alliance also set up land,
            sea, and sky blockades to prevent military supplies from entering
            the country and getting into the rebels’ hands. However, in doing
            so, it had also blocked humanitarian aid from reaching the Yemeni
            civilians, who were desperately in need.
          </p>
          <p>
            Many might wonder, why is Saudi Arabia fighting so vigorously in
            this domestic warfare? In response, according to Elizabeth Kendall -
            senior researcher at the University of Oxford - Saudi Arabia has
            expressed three central war aims.
          </p>
          <p>
            First, the nation wanted to restore President Hadi's power. Doing so
            would be for the Saudis' best interests as they would be more at
            ease with Yemen being under the control of a centralized government.
          </p>
          <p>
            Second, the country strived to protect the southern border it shares
            with Yemen and prevent the rebels from controlling Bab-el-Mandeb
            Strait - one of the most important shipping routes of oil in the
            world that lies between the southwestern tip of Yemen and the
            African nations of Eritrea and Djibouti
          </p>
          <p>
            Lastly, and most importantly, the Arab state wanted to contain the
            perceived growing influence of Iran in the region. The Saudis’ fear
            of Iran gaining power in the region is understandable, as the two
            nations had been long-time rivals due to many reasons, including
            Iran being the most significant Shiʿi power in the region and Saudi
            Arabia being majorly Sunni. However, why is Iran related to the war?
            Despite denying the accusations of direct military aid, Iran had
            proclaimed its public support for the Houthis, and there was
            evidence that the weapons used by the rebels were Iranian-produced.
          </p>
          <p>
            The situation is the prototypal example of proxy war - where two
            countries - in this case, Iran and Saudi Arabia - support opposing
            sides in a foreign war. It could almost be perceived that the two
            countries are at war without declaring one with each other.

          <p>
            Regardless of the truth about military involvement, the mere
            presence of Iran immensely complicated the situation. Many western
            countries - namely the U.S., the U.K., and France - became active in
            the war due to their friendly economic relationships with Saudi
            Arabia and rivalries - chiefly the U.S. - with Iran. These western
            governments provided the Saudis with logistical and military support
            during the mission to restore the Yemeni government.
          </p>
          <p>
            As a result, the civil war in Yemen had evolved into a full
            international dispute by 2016 - with the U.S., the U.K., France, and
            Saudi-led coalition backing the Hadi government, and Iran backing
            the Houthi rebel forces.
          </p>
          <h4>Growing Complexity and Alliance Disputes (2017 - 2019)</h4>
          <p>
            In December 2017, former president Saleh shocked the world by
            breaking his alliance on TV and saying that he was willing to
            negotiate a solution with the Saudi-led coalition. To many Yemenis,
            Saleh was the one and only president they had ever known; struggling
            under the Houthis' rule, they had been desperately waiting for Saleh
            to take a stand towards mediation. However, the moment they dreamt
            of did not materialize. Merely two days after switching sides, Saleh
            was assassinated just outside of the capital city. The Houthis soon
            claimed his death.
          </p>
          <p>
            Taking away the only hope for reconciliation, the Houthis were now
            the target for both the forces loyal to Saleh and the Saudi-led
            coalition. However, perhaps due to their familiarity with the
            battlefields and the support from Iran, the Yemeni government and
            Saudi-led coalition had only managed to reclaim parts of the
            Houthis' territory in the south. By the end of 2019, the Houthis
            still occupy a large portion of the western region, which is the
            most populous.
          </p>
          <p>
            Meanwhile, another alliance - in addition to the Houthi-Saleh union
            - had begun to show cracks. Despite its name, the Saudi-led
            coalition was chiefly organized by both Saudi Arabia and the United
            Arab Emirates (UAE). The two nations took responsibility for battles
            in different parts of Yemen - Saudis in the north and the Emirates
            in the south. While everyone expected them to be working towards the
            same goal, the UAE shockingly declared its support of the Southern
            Transitional Council (STC) - a southern separatist group - in 2017.
            Many suspect that the newly-formed alliance was based on the reasons
            that the UAE developed friendly relations with people of the south
            after four three years of collaboration, and that the Emirates value
            the STC because they are good fighters against terrorist
            organizations like the AQAP and the rising power of the Islamic
            State. Also, President Hadi had been in exile in Saudi Arabia for an
            extended period of time, causing him to lose contact and support
            from the locals in the south - specifically Aden, where his
            government is based. All of the above contributed to the seemingly
            effortless conquest of Aden by the UAE-backed STC in 2018.
          </p>
          <p>
            At this point in the war, the civilian deaths had reached an amount
            too horrendous to be ignored. The airstrikes administered by the
            Saudi-led coalitions began to receive international criticism, as
            the damages they caused were so significant and detrimental that the
            UN had categorized the aerial attacks as war crimes. Being the
            leading supplier of aerial weapons to the Saudis, the U.S. entered a
            realm of internal debates regarding the true nature of its
            involvement in the war. Many Americans took the streets to demand an
            exit to the war when the scandal of Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin
            Salman and the murder of the journalist Jamal Khashoggi broke out.
            Moreover, officials acknowledged the alarming trend of Yemeni youths
            joining extremist groups in retaliation to the U.S.’s involvement in
            the destruction of their county. However, as President Trump -
            against the dismay of most Americans - vetoes the Senate's bill to
            end the U.S’s military support in Yemen in 2019, there is little
            prospect of an end to the chaotic war and the mass civilian
            suffering.

          <h4>Present and Future (2020 - Future)</h4>
          <p>
            The current situation in Yemen is dire, to say the least. Neither of
            the two major opposition parties – the Iran-supported Houthis and
            the Saudi-backed Yemeni governmental forces – show any signs of
            willingness to negotiate. The constant disruptions caused by
            terrorist groups - including ISIS and the world’s most dangerous
            branch of al-Qaeda - as well as more than twenty national
            secessionist forces only complicate matters further.

            Meanwhile, Yemeni civilians – whose casualties are estimated to be
            at least 100,000 since 2015 – are struggling to survive.
          </p>
          <p>
            The United Nations summarized the crisis in 2020 with the
            characteristics of “widespread poverty, conflict, poor governance
            and weak rule of law, including widely reported human rights
            violations”. Unfortunately, the international humanitarian
            assistance – which an estimated 24.1 million civilians, or
            two-thirds of the population, depends on for survival – continues to
            be used by the Saudi-led coalition as a tactic in war, despite the
            UN’s repetitive condemnation. Moreover, with the newest challenge
            brought forth by the COVID-19 pandemic, the desperately needed
            medical aids and emergency supplies shorten further as the global
            focus shifts away from the crumbling nation.
          </p>
          <p>
            The United Nations states that ending the war would be the only
            solution to this growing crisis. However, the war in Yemen consists
            of multiple oppositions of numerous international and national
            parties. To put an end to the war – or at least the foreign
            intervention in the civil war – would not be easy, as demonstrated
            by the multiple failed attempts at negotiation, but it can be
            achieved if the more stable and powerful countries – such as the
            U.S. – can take the initiative and actions.
          </p>
          <p>
            On the positive side, with the recent increase of international
            attention, experts discover sparks of hope within the war-torn
            nation.
          </p>
          <p>
            “If you give the young people...the women...and the non-elites a
            chance to be part of the process to develop a solution for Yemen,
            there is hope, because they are brilliant, smart people. They just
            have been left out of the whole process and discussion.”, said
            Director Muhammedally of the Middle East and South Asia Center for
            Civilians in Conflict.
          </p>
          <p>
            Henrietta Fore, the executive director of the United Nations
            International Children’s Emergency Fund (UNICEF), also saw hope
            after interacting with Yemeni children in UN-protected areas. “Many
            of these children have seen so much dying, but if we can get them to
            these safe places, they begin to have psychosocial support...and
            begin to put some of those memories into a place that they can deal
            with it and live with it.”, she said after her visit.
          </p>
          <p>
            Ever since the beginning of the nation, the civilians had too often
            been suffering and ignored. Yemen is known throughout the Middle
            East as "Yemen al-sa'id", which means “happy Yemen” or “optimistic
            Yemen”, according to Rabyaah Althaibani, the founder of the Arab
            Women’s Voice.
          </p>
          <p>
            The battle between international and national forces hangs tens of
            millions of Yemeni civilians’ lives on a thread. They crave for a
            solution, for stability, and for peace.
          </p>
          <p>
            Yet, their future depends partially on our governments and us. Will
            we, as outsiders to this catastrophic humanitarian crisis, help them
            achieve a future of happiness and optimism?
