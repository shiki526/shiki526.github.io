        Redlining and Racial SegregationThe Fight for Native American Equality:
        Freedom and Justice for All?
        <h3 class="author">By: Dorothy Chan</h3>

          <p>
            The recent surge of support for the Black Lives Matter movement has
            highlighted the widespread implementation of systemic racism against
            the Black community in America. One contributor to institutionalized
            racism is the act of redlining, the past practice of partitioning a
            city into color-coded sections. Each color represented the
            desirability of certain areas to be invested in and the probability
            of being lent mortgages or loans to. Redlining was first implemented
            after the Great Depression to resolve the housing shortage in
            America, but at the expense of minorities, especially black
            communities. It was officially practiced when the National Housing
            Act of 1934 was passed, which then caused the Federal Housing
            Administration (FHA) to be established to reinforce the policies
            that actively exacerbated segregation in America’s housing markets.
            This, in turn, facilitated a “state-sponsored system of
            segregation,” as author Richard Rothstein labeled it.
          </p>
          <p>
            One direct consequence of redlining was that it significantly
            delayed the process of urbanization in redlined areas. BIPOC
            individuals were forcibly congregated into neighborhoods composed of
            housing projects, which have historically been associated with
            negative connotations of poverty and crime. Cities, such as Detroit
            and Newark, were also deterred from investing in these areas,
            resulting in the deterioration of public infrastructures such as
            schools and roads. Not to mention, individuals that lived in these
            redlined communities were denied basic services such as banking,
            insurance, and even access to supermarkets. This resulted in
            declines in property value, declines in literacy rates, and
            increases in crime rates.
          </p>
          <p>
            Private lenders took advantage of this situation by participating in
            a newly introduced practice called predatory lending. They sought
            out black families who were denied by other banks for financial aid,
            and convinced them to take out loans with high-interest rates with
            the intention of leaving them in economic distress. These lenders
            essentially manipulated this disadvantageous situation for their own
            economic gain at the expense of the financial well being of many
            black families.
          </p>
          <p>
            Redlining was outlawed as a result of the Fair Housing Act of 1968,
            which initiated the process of desegregation in America’s housing
            market. As a result of this, neighborhoods began diversifying due to
            the influx of black families moving into dense white-populated
            areas.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, this triggered a phenomenon known as “white flight,”
            referring to when white families moved from urban areas to suburban
            areas with the incentive of low-interest rates as cities became more
            desegregated. However, as white families migrated to other areas,
            they brought their taxes along with them. So, considering that the
            newly moved-in black families were unable to make up for the lack of
            funds as a result of decades of discrimination that stunted their
            economic mobility, this led to an urban decline in metropolitan
            areas.
          </p>
          <p>
            Redlining, despite being outlawed for over 50 years, has caused
            apparent inequalities in our society that ultimately still make it a
            relevant issue to discuss today.
          </p>
          <p>
            One long-lasting effect is the racial wealth gap in America. This
            stemmed from the fact that black individuals were denied the ability
            to purchase homes due to redlining. Consequently, they were unable
            to accumulate generational wealth through property value and equity.
            Considering that generational wealth is mostly derived from property
            ownership, it is unsurprising that the black-white economic gap is
            still unresolved since the Great Depression.
          </p>
          <p>
            Another effect is the modern-day school to prison pipeline, which is
            a phenomenon in which students of color, especially black children,
            are actively pushed out of schools and into juvenile detention
            centers and prisons. For many, the pipeline starts in underfunded
            schools lacking adequate resources. This is a commonality seen in
            many underprivileged black neighborhoods as a result of redlining.
            Without the availability of basic materials including writing
            utensils, textbooks, and even guidance counselors, black students
            are put at a disadvantage. In addition to other factors including
            zero-tolerance behavioral standard policies and over-policing in
            predominantly black schools, this leads to disproportionate
            suspensions, expulsions, and even arrests among black students.
            Students are then pushed towards detention centers and prisons
            without an adequate education. Even if given the opportunity to be
            reintroduced into society, the lack of resources to guide them
            ultimately counteracts their attempts to do so. From every stage of
            the school to prison pipeline, black students are constantly
            disadvantaged solely due to the systemic racism in our country.
          </p>
          <p>
            Unfortunately, the racial wealth gap and the school to prison
            pipeline are only two examples of the many racial disparities
            present in our society. These problems, despite being highlighted by
            the current Black Lives Matter movement, have mattered for decades
            prior. It is not enough to reform our country, but to completely
            dismantle and rebuild our fundamental systems in order to protect
            those that have been failed by our past and present political
            leaders and legislative systems.
