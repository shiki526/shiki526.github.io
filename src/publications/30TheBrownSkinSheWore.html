          <h3>Story</h3>
          <p>
            There was a smoldering silence before an ear-splitting scream
            erupted from the crowd.
          </p>
          <p>“They shot her in cold blood!”</p>
          <p>
            Her footsteps came to a stop as she was helplessly rooted to her
            spot. Her body jerked back; crimson fluids erupted from the wound,
            staining the front of her white blouse, drenching it, and
            splattering everywhere uncontrollably. She desperately held the
            wound; her body was punctured by one who swore an oath to protect
            the people. Blood sprayed between her fingers and flowed across the
            distance between her and her murderer. She gurgled her last words as
            blood gushed from her mouth, and dribbled down her chin. Her breath
            weighed heavy in her chest, as she gasped for air. Her eyes bulged
            from their sockets as another bullet hit her stomach. She flinched
            backward. She gasped again. Her eyes rolled back into her skull as
            her legs gave way. The sound of her bones crumbling echoed as her
            knees hit the ground. The crowd roared as her head smashed itself
            against the cold, hard concrete. Her lifeless body laid on the
            pavement. A pool of blood leaked from the two shotgun wounds in her
            stomach. Her mouth jarred open as blood continued to dribble and
            flow into the pool of blood that surrounded her body. The crimson
            pool stretched itself across the concrete. It reached the crowd and
            slivered between the stomping feet until it found the only pair that
            were still.
          </p>
          <p>
            The blood arrived at its destination in the front of his trainers;
            the fabric welcomed her in. The soles absorbed the last of her until
            she was gone. The wetness of her blood sat under his toes; the
            coldness of her blood made him scrunch them. He wished to scurry
            away from her blood filling his shoes. He choked as the stench of
            blood and gunpowder hung itself in the dead air. It made his stomach
            churn. His eyes fixated on the stillness of her body.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span class="italic">Get up! Get up! Get up! Get up!</span> He
            wanted to scream at her.
          </p>
          <p>
            The words never made it past his lips; they strained in his throat.
            He swallowed his cry in a gulp. He wanted to push past the erupting
            crowd, to run to her, to shake her body. He wanted her to move
            again. He wanted her to roll over, get up, and feel her humming
            smile as she laughed at him. It felt as if all of this was some sort
            of sick joke, but it was reality. She was dead. All he could do was
            stand there amongst the vexed crowd as they marched with their fists
            in the air. Enraged strangers threw and rammed their bodies against
            the plastic shields that protected the man in a uniform who had
            promised to look after the people. His—-, their—- ,promise was only
            for the white and privileged. The boyfriend reminisced back to her
            attempt to make him try and understand his privilege.
          </p>
          <p class="italic">
            “It’s the 21st century.” He looked at her baffled.
          </p>
          <p class="italic">
            “That does not mean racism still isn’t present. I feel them glaring
            at me when I am with you, as though interracial couples are still
            illegal. As if, I am not good enough for you. They look at me as
            though I am an alien because I don’t share the same skin as you. I
            want them to see me as a normal person. Do you even see me? Or do
            you see my 'exotic' skin?” He was taken back by her question.
          </p>
          <p class="italic">
            “Of course, I see you,” He said calmly, his eyes fixed on her. His
            heart ached and grew with regret as he watched her eyes grow cold.
          </p>
          <p class="italic">She stayed fixed in her spot.</p>
          <p class="italic">
            Her eyes shifted across his face, examining the blank expression he
            wore in an attempt to conceal his true emotions. Anger slowly brewed
            as it was not the first time they had a disagreement on the topic of
            race and ‘privilege’. He did not understand why she considered him
            ‘privileged’ because of the difference in their skin. He did not
            understand why she felt racism was still present. ‘It is the 21st
            century’, he would think to himself but not dare say it aloud. After
            watching the news to see another protest, he would say “It was just
            an arrest that went wrong” while she would say “A murder and it is
            police brutality.” They could never see eye to eye.
          </p>
          <p class="italic">
            “Bullshit." Her face was paler than he had never seen before; it was
            as if her blood was slipping away from his presence. As guilt crept
            into him, he broke his gaze with hers. He buried his head into his
            hands as she continued under her breath, just loud enough for him to
            hear.
          </p>
          <p class="italic">
            “You are privileged. If a police officer pulled you over, they would
            calmly ask you to step out of the car-”
          </p>
          <p class="italic">“They would for anyone- “</p>
          <p class="italic">
            “Not for me. I don’t have the same privilege as you do” Her eyes
            were stern; she wore no expression on her face.
          </p>
          <p>
            At the time, he did not understand what she meant. They did not see
            her; they saw the brown skin she was given. To the people in the
            uniform, her skin was a weapon that was more threatening than the
            loaded guns in their holsters. He understood. He understood that
            since he was one of the white protesters in the crowd, he had not
            been beaten, sprayed, or verbally abused by the police. The white
            protesters were simply shoved aside to watch their fellow allies
            face the wrath of police brutality. All because they did not share
            the same skin. He had to witness the murder of his girlfriend to
            begin to understand what she had meant to finally understand.
          </p>
          <p>He was beginning to understand his white privilege.</p>
