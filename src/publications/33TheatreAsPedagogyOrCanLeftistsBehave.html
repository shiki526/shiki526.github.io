        Theatre as Pedagogy: or, Can Leftists Behave?

            Author’s Note: For the bulk of the research for this article, I
            sought the input of my colleagues, Cornelio Aguilera and Dr.
            Clareann Despain, both practitioners of Boal’s Theatre of the
            Oppressed, and activists with abundant experience in social justice
            work between them. Their thoughts will be presented alongside my own
            throughout. This article would not have been possible without their
            contributions, nor without the firsthand experience working with
            them and with our fellow ensemble members of the Outcast Theatre
            Collective, which is why I choose to credit them first and foremost
            here.

          <h3>A Preface (Not a Prescription)</h3>
          <p>
            I don’t want to suggest that all leftist spaces have issues with
            intra-group conflict. For one thing, I’ve not been in every single
            leftist organization or collective, so I obviously can’t make such a
            blanket statement about activists and “in-fighting.” Well, I can,
            but it would be disingenuous -- and besides, about four different
            New York Times writers have already staked their own claims on that
            particular brand of half-baked editorializing. A good deal of the
            progressive spaces into which I have inserted myself were not
            plagued by the stereotypes of the sniping or supposed ideological
            purity that are so synonymous with our reputation. This is probably
            because of the combination of the temperaments of the individuals,
            the culture created within the group, and the clarity of our
            purpose. I have also been in those spaces where there are plenty of
            organizers who do not know how to act, and I’m sure if you’re
            reading this, you probably have too, and some vivid examples are now
            coming to mind. I absolutely don’t want to suggest that in-fighting
            is unique to leftist organizing. It isn’t. (Look for footage of the
            Libertarian National Convention.) But I’m also really not interested
            in hashing out the ideological conflicts outside of my own team,
            which is why the magnifying glass is going to be on ourselves for
            this discussion. Because, unfair or not, petty squabbling is
            associated with our movements.
          </p>
          <p>
            To be absolutely clear: I’m not here to diagnose the causes of
            dissent, nor am I suggesting a prescription with the intent of
            ending it. I love dissent. I’m a loud, annoying little Irish-Italian
            Jew. I live to argue. More saliently, dissent is necessary. It’s
            necessary in order to ground our movements in the realities of our
            people, it’s necessary in order to accommodate shifting priorities
            in the face of ever-evolving threats, and it’s necessary in order to
            foster critical thinking and thus, anti-authoritarianism. If our
            organizations are as heterogeneous as they should be, disagreements
            over policies, objectives, methodology, and whether or not we should
            order Tijuana Flats aren’t just inevitable; they’re wellness checks
            for the movement.
          </p>
          <p>
            But if you’re like me and you’ve sat through a plurality of IWW
            meetings that were derailed by people calling each other “tankies”
            and “ancaps”, you probably know that there are plenty of ineffective
            (or just idiotic) ways to fight. Even I, who has just professed love
            for arguments, do not enjoy fights. That’s what I want to talk
            about. We’ve got to get better at arguing with one another. Like it
            or not, our exaggerated reputation of being willing to throw down
            over minutiae is still based somewhat in reality. Unwarranted or
            disproportionate viciousness is as ubiquitous and persistent in some
            of our groups as it is anathema to the very ideals we allegedly
            promote in those same spaces.
          </p>
          <p>
            There are innumerable factors that lead to these nasty dynamics, the
            most pertinent being the frameworks within which these groups
            operate that reproduce systemic oppressions throughout the space,
            including in the make-up of their hierarchies. The desire to uphold
            the status usually afforded to the privileged by these same power
            imbalances outside this space can be seen in the frequently caustic
            reactions of white, able-bodied, cisgender, heterosexual, male
            leftists when their authority or neutrality is challenged within the
            space. If you’re a trans or gay activist like myself, or a Black
            organizer, or disabled, or any other iteration of person subjugated
            under the hegemony we act against, you may have had at least one
            moment where your specific concerns were dismissed, cast aside, or
            labeled as “idpol”, a perjorative for identity politics (a term
            itself now employed derisively by conservatives either unaware or
            apathetic of its definition). Often this classification is made out
            of the belief that anything outside of class analysis are
            “distractions” from the “real” oppression. I’ve seen this play out
            even in spaces that purport to be “collective”, “democratic”, and
            “non-hierarchical,” which can make these dismissals even more
            insidious. These actors end up maintaining the very hierarchies that
            they claim do not exist… which creates conditions conducive to
            pervasive in-fighting.
          </p>
          <p>
            Both of these issues -- an inability to engage without
            dehumanization and an unwillingness to acknowledge and reckon with
            privilege -- will severely inhibit movements from gaining any
            momentum. Groups that are plagued by either one of these problems
            will hemorrhage members, and spaces in which both of these dynamics
            are simultaneously at play simply will not -- and should not --
            survive in any beneficial way. But I also don’t believe that these
            conditions are inevitable, because they are created, which means
            that they can be addressed.
          </p>
          <p>
            My belief is informed not only by my positive experiences in
            multiple organizations, but also in a more general sense by my
            experience in the professional theatre community. Collaborative arts
            need to accommodate a rogues’ gallery of individuals, all with their
            own methods and madnesses. Specifically, there is overlap between
            social justice movements and artistic practitioners of techniques
            such as Augusto Boal’s Theatre of the Oppressed, which emphasizes
            democratic, non-hierarchical structures where decisions are
            collectively reached through the process of consensus-building as
            opposed to merely voting. I think it’s abundantly clear that leftist
            and progressive groups can learn much from Boal’ s techniques; in
            fact, I believe that they were created with that very intention in
            mind.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="row">
          <h3>Shifting from the Vote to the Consensus</h3>
          <p>
            The most common decision-making process exercised by a democratic
            collective would obviously be voting, though any of us will be quick
            to admit that this system is far from perfect. The search for any
            perfect system is an exercise in futility, but the endeavor to
            create a better system is as obligated as it is unending. It's worth
            digressing to briefly acknowledge the limit of voting as practiced
            in our various organized gaggles.
          </p>
          <p>
            Despite the very best of efforts and the sincerest of intents,
            voting can still result in dissatisfaction and a lack of resolution.
            As Dr. Despain points out, "Voting offers participants fixed choices
            that are often pre-determined. Often voting means that those who
            have been outvoted feel disenfranchised. Voting also tends to
            encourage adherence to one option that you fall in line behind."
          </p>
          <p>
            This can elevate the stakes of decision-making so that discussions
            become debates and comrades become opponents. If the voting
            mechanism in place also contributes to a slogging bureaucracy that
            slows results and overwhelms its members, the tensions can increase
            exponentially.
          </p>
          <p>
            Finally, that sensation of having little power is even more founded
            in reality when decisions are made by a plurality of members as
            opposed to a majority. For a more detailed explanation on the
            complications that arise from that specific snafu, I highly
            recommend watching Hasan Minhaj’s piece on how the United States in
            particular has an embarrassment of an electoral system (Patriot Act,
            Vol. 6, Ep. 7). Even if a group employs ranked voting for certain
            decisions that involve more than two choices, there will still be a
            faction of “losers.” How do we move towards a system where
            collective decision-making is not a matter of competition, but
            cooperation?
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="row">
          <p>
            It's appropriate that Dr. Despain mentions the particular hurdle of
            time constraints. While it's not the only limitation of the process,
            it's likely one of the more obvious ones, with few easy fixes unless
            your deadline is flexible-- unfortunately congressional votes or
            opening nights tend not to be very forgiving. Cornelio Aguilera
            brings it up immediately when I query the two of them about the
            obstacles to reaching an agreement that everyone is satisfied with:
            “The amount of time required to do [the process justice] could be
            considered a challenge. I also believe those involved with the
            attempt have to be truly vested in what is being considered, and
            fully understand all sides that are being represented.” However, as
            Dr. Despain mentioned above, the more familiar a group is with each
            other and with the process, the quicker it may become over time, and
            the less likely that there will be a lack of clarity or a breakdown
            in communication. Groups with a strong foundation and history
            together will be more likely to successfully work through being
            rushed, although of course, the adaptability of the approach will
            depend on the number of members, how imminent the deadline is, and
            how cohesive the group dynamic is. Tangentially, I think it’s fair
            to assert that transitioning from a voting model to a
            discussion-based model wouldn’t do much of anything to alleviate
            bureaucracy.
          </p>
          <p>
            I think the stickier complications arise as members multiply. For
            starters, there is a point at which there are just too many people
            to hear out at length. “The bigger the group, the harder it is,” Dr.
            Despain remarks. “The faster the decision needs to be made, the
            harder it is. Consensus building wouldn’t work at the Federal level
            because there’s simply not time to hear everyone out.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Presently, it doesn’t appear that much does work at the federal
            level, but I do shudder to think of a hypothetical attempt to reach
            a consensus between every individual in the nation. The numbers
            alone are daunting, but that’s far from the only reason why this
            system would be disastrous as a proposed replacement for our current
            electoral mechanism. There must be a starting threshold, a baseline
            truth that all members accept, from which discourse can begin. To
            put it bluntly: this is not a system you want to adopt for a
            populace in which not everyone agrees on the humanity of all of its
            members. The distance in ideology is just too vast.
          </p>
          <p>
            Frankly, I would even hesitate to recommend this system in some
            purely leftist or ostensibly progressive spaces. I pride myself in
            having a pretty long fuse (though these days, I have definitely been
            tested), but I would still rather swallow a live grenade than attend
            a tea party with Bari Weiss, let alone attempt to reach a consensus
            with her. The bottom line: humanity is non-negotiable, and anyone
            who disputes this would be a nonstarter in this model.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Consensus building is harder when there are massive divides in
            ideology,” Dr. Despain says. “It’s much easier when the participants
            are philosophically on the same page about the work they are doing.
            At the same time, consensus building discourages groupthink by
            encouraging participants to consider their own subjectivity and the
            subjectivity of others.”
          </p>
          <p>But is this consideration of subjectivity enough?</p>
          <p class="italic">Maybe.</p>
          <p>It depends.</p>
          <p>
            During our conversations, Cornelio Aguilera had used what I think is
            a fitting analogy: a relay race. Some people run the race in the
            interest of self-improvement; these individuals are competing only
            with their past selves, and the goal is progress. Others run the
            race as a competition, not to better themselves, but to be better
            than the runners in the lanes beside them. The question Aguilera
            posed is, for me, the big determiner:
            <span class="italic"
              >“Are we trying to run this race in order to dominate the people
              that we’re running it with?”</span
            >
          </p>
          <p>
            <span class="bold">This</span> is the starting line, the question
            whose answer I believe is the most significant arbiter of whether or
            not a leftist organization can be improved by transitioning to a
            consensus-based decision-making model, or whether its foundation is
            simply too rotten to weather the progress that time brings.
          </p>
          <p>
            I also suspect that many, if not most, of the leaders who might
            secretly answer in the affirmative to that question are the same
            leftists who dismiss the concerns of their less privileged comrades
            by labeling those objections “idpol.” The business of dominating
            other humans is not one that is unique to the Right.
          </p>
          <p>
            But I do want to caution us against believing that the answer to
            that question is determined by some unchanging aspect inherent to a
            person, or that the answer we give to that question doesn’t change
            based on our circumstances, or our choices, or whether we had a
            shitty day. I know that usually, my answer to that question is the
            most militant of “no’s”. But I also possess a vindictive streak; I
            confess that on more than one occasion, (a lot more), upon
            encountering someone else unrepentantly running the race for
            superiority, my reaction has been to go Tonya Harding on a bitch.
            Funny? Mostly. Justified? Perhaps. A helpful choice? Probably not.
          </p>
          <p>
            On a lark, I asked my two friends how we might persuade people to
            join our race instead. “Well, that’s the million dollar question,
            right?” Dr. Despain said. “That’s what political organizers are
            asking, that’s what artists are asking, that’s what writers are
            asking, that’s what educators are asking. That’s what everyone is
            asking. [...] Before you can get to consensus-building, you have to
            get [everyone] on the same page, and I don’t know that
            consensus-building is a way to do that. [...] But Theatre of the
            Oppressed is about doing that, because it starts with empathy, and
            allowing for the humanity of others, and putting yourself in someone
            else’s shoes.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Before we pivot to a broader discussion of Theatre of the Oppressed,
            one last word on consensus-building: any system that involves
            multiple independent actors will run the risk of its abuse. Some
            models are more prone to abuse than others, but none are completely
            invulnerable to it. The three of us eventually found it prudent in
            our discussions to troubleshoot the ways in which consensus-building
            specifically can be exploited in the aim of domination, so that
            there can be some warning for anyone who may find themselves in such
            an environment.
          </p>
          <p>
            This facet was first brought to my attention in one of Aguilera’s
            answers regarding clarity and communication: “If not utilized
            uniformly and correctly,” he cautioned, “the integrity of this way
            of organizing can be abused, potentially causing there to be a
            distrust [of the system].[...] Complete and clear communication is
            necessary, which can be difficult to achieve and therefore, limiting
            for this type of organizing.” When Dr. Despain added that a
            breakdown in communication could lead to assumed consent (in
            response to silence or otherwise), I realized that the question
            needed to be pursued further. I asked about potential red flags that
            anyone entering a space -- theatrical, activist, or otherwise --
            should take as cues to remain vigilant. Her response was almost
            immediate:
          </p>
          <p>
            “Any hierarchy that pretends to be non-hierarchical is a trap. Any
            system where we refuse to recognize the humanity and the failings of
            the leaders. And that’s on the leader, not necessarily on the
            participants. [...] It means people aren’t contributing, they’re
            being dragged along for the ride. And then that means that when
            there is dissent, it gets subsumed under the will of the leader.
            [...] It means that when it pops up later, the leader goes, ‘well,
            why didn’t you bring that up earlier? We’re not hierarchical. This
            is consensus-building, you should have said something!’ But when it
            feels like there are negative consequences for disagreeing with
            leadership [...] people aren’t gonna speak up.”
          </p>
          <p>What do we watch out for in our leaders?</p>
          <p>
            “A resistance to accountability. All of us have an initial defensive
            impulse when we receive critique of any kind, and part of the work
            is, of course, finding a way to
            <span class="italic">offer</span> critique without inspiring
            [defensiveness], and also figuring out how to
            <span class="italic">receive</span> it. Someone is telling me I left
            my headlights on. They’re not saying I’m a bad person, they’re
            saying I left my headlights on. This is a lifelong process for
            everyone, learning to accept it that way. But if I haven’t seen any
            evidence that you’ve at least committed to
            <span class="italic">trying</span>
            to do that work, that’s a red flag.”
          </p>
          <p>
            At this, Aguilera added that in a true non-hierarchical structure,
            “diversity in thinking needs to be welcomed.” To me, this means
            questioning… and returns us to the necessity of dissent. Again:
            dissent, not fights. A disagreement can be blunt, even vitriolic,
            but fights will poison the dynamic of the group.
          </p>
          <p>
            “So the key is,” Dr. Despain says, “to create an environment where
            creative problem solving and collaboration are encouraged, and
            [give] space for everyone to speak.”

          <h3>The General Utility of Theatre of the Oppressed</h3>
          <p>
            Theatre of the Oppressed refers to a grouping of theatrical forms
            first created in the ‘50s, ‘60s, and ‘70s by Augusto Boal, a
            Brazilian dramatist, activist, and pedagogue. His theories were
            heavily influenced by Paulo Freire and his
            <span class="italic">Pedagogy of the Oppressed.</span> All forms --
            image theatre, forum theatre, legislative theatre, newspaper
            theatre, invisible theatre, etc. -- are fully interactive, with the
            ultimate objective of making active participants out of what would
            be audience members. This is reflected in the terminology; all
            involved in the undertaking are referred to as “spect-actors”, with
            the exception of the “joker”, or the facilitator, who is a
            completely neutral guide and is not permitted to comment on the
            proceedings. As the name suggests, these techniques were formulated
            as a means to address social ills while giving agency to those
            involved, and ensembles that practice Theatre of the Oppressed are
            meant to be democratic and non-hierarchical.
          </p>
          <p>
            For this reason, consensus-building is a regular practice for those
            ensembles, including that of the Outcast Theatre Collective, to
            which Cornelio Aguilera, Dr. Clareann Despain, and I all belong. The
            manner in which discussions are conducted in spaces like these could
            serve as an example of successful discursive cooperation.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Something that I love about consensus building with TOTO [Theatre
            of the Oppressed] is that a space set aside for theatrical rehearsal
            is often already an environment where creative problem-solving and
            collaboration is encouraged. Theatre people are trained to
            collaborate and love to help solve problems,” Dr. Despain points
            out. It’s absolutely true; if theatre companies had fights within
            their membership with the same vitriol and regularity that many
            leftist activists do, no plays would ever be produced.
          </p>
          <p>
            “There is an attempt at establishing an equal weight to all the
            participants that make up the group,” Aguilera tells me. “It is made
            up of an understanding that we each are responsible for making up
            our part of the puzzle, and [this] helps us depend on one another to
            deliver that piece in order for the picture we are presenting to
            succeed. This focus on the final creation is what drives us to work
            together and I believe it helps us work past any other
            distractions.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Collective focus can only be achieved with stalwart cooperation… and
            collective focus is necessary to achieve collective objectives.
          </p>
          <p>What about the other utilities of Theatre of the Oppressed?</p>
          <p>
            Both Cornelio Aguilera’s and Dr. Clareann Despain’s answers share a
            common, recurring theme: empathy and critical thinking.
          </p>
          <p>
            “We have a tendency to rely on our words and communication more
            heavily than the impulses and feelings that can be conjured up more
            quickly and effectively when working around an issue,” Aguilera
            muses. “Boal’s work shows us the difference between working from the
            head instead of the heart, and helps us find a way to reverse that
            in order to better understand oppressive experiences we have/may
            have/will live through.”
          </p>
          <p>
            I can tell you from experience that this process can be a difficult
            one. It’s a challenge to shift from cerebral, constructed language
            to unfiltered honesty. It’s akin to removing all consonants and
            being left with only vowels to communicate. But as alien as that
            mode is to us, it is freeing to identify and unlearn certain
            constructions that we’ve absorbed as means to create distance from
            the full weight of truth.
          </p>
          <p>
            From Dr. Despain: “Something that’s deeply profound about Theatre of
            the Oppressed is the way it is designed to de-mechanize the body.
            We’re efficiency machines. Whenever they can, our bodies find the
            way of doing what we need them to do and then find the most
            efficient way of doing it and then stick to it. What we don’t always
            understand is the ways in which that mechanizes our physical
            responses to everything. Of course, it’s not just biological
            efficiency that dictates this mechanization. We are socialized to
            present our bodies certain ways and to move them in certain ways. We
            discipline children who wiggle too much in public, we stare at the
            person on the subway who hasn’t mastered sitting silently still
            [...] Our bodies are disciplined in ways we don’t even realize. Boal
            calls the way we internalize these restrictions the “Cops in the
            Head;” Foucault [...] talks about panopticism. Boal’s techniques
            force us to explore the possibilities of the body in ways we haven’t
            since we were children. [...] Through those explorations we can
            recognize the ways in which our physicality is constrained by
            physical and social forces. It’s incredibly exciting work because it
            perfectly sets up the process of decolonizing the mind. As part of
            the body, the mind benefits from the physical freedoms explored by
            Boal. In addition, by beginning with physical examples of the
            impacts of the “Cops in the Head,” Boal’s exercises prime us to
            examine the way social forces contain our behavior on a
            psychological level. This opens us up to examine privilege in new
            ways.”
          </p>
          <p>
            We return then, to the examination of privilege, and in a way, to
            the spaces that purport to be non-hierarchical but are not. Is it
            possible for a group to operate non-hierarchically, even
            anarchistically, without reckoning with the politics of identity? Is
            it really acceptable to claim that you work to end hierarchies if
            you ignore the ways in which privilege operates in your own house?
          </p>
          <p>
            “I think activist spaces and [Theatre of the Oppressed] are trying
            to solve similar issues,” Dr. Despain says. “We’re all coming at it
            from a variety of angles which I think is valuable. [...] We cannot
            confront oppression if we don’t acknowledge how privilege is bound
            up in identity. [...] In order for consensus building to bend toward
            social justice, it means that the spaces it's operating in must be
            diverse and non-hierarchical. Non-hierarchical doesn’t work if
            participants can’t acknowledge their privilege and the way it
            impacts interactions. Even when we’re explicitly attempting to be
            non-hierarchical, the fact is that the power dynamics created by
            systemic racism, sexism, homophobia, transphobia, ableism,
            fatphobia, etc. still influence all of our interactions. It’s
            important to be aware of those things and explicitly acknowledge
            them. Conscientious consensus building, then, demands that these
            issues be a part of the conversation as we establish our
            priorities.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Theatre of the Oppressed, particularly forum theatre, has a penchant
            for providing clear scenarios in which observers can more easily
            discern and name privilege. Could this be an effective approach to
            teaching leftists that these forces are not just existent, but
            powerful? Dr. Despain thinks so.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Theatre of the Oppressed may not be able to change the minds of
            people who hold extremist views -- although, we have to be open to
            that possibility -- but Theatre of the Oppressed is really great for
            encouraging people who perhaps haven’t encountered the question of
            privilege, [...] and having people experience what it might be like
            to not have it, and then deconstructing it.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Recognition of these systemic obstacles and malignancies is
            compulsory if we want to achieve true freedom from hierarchical
            hegemony, but Dr. Despain cautions that this, like everything else,
            requires patience:
          </p>
          <p>
            “We’ve got to remember that no one thing -- no one event, no one
            experience, is going to be the thing that takes somebody ‘all the
            way,’ because there’s no one place for people with privilege to
            arrive.”
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="row">
          <h3>Final Thoughts</h3>
          <p>
            There will never be one answer to how our work should be done. The
            suggestions proposed here do not reflect a belief on my part that
            they are either easy to adopt or effective in any or all spaces. I
            do, however, believe that the tactics suggested here -- both
            consensus-building as a collective decision-making process as well
            as utilizing Theatre of the Oppressed in a more general sense -- are
            at least worth attempting when possible.
          </p>
          <p>
            I also want to repeat emphatically that my suggestion of
            consensus-building over voting is not a prescription for ending
            in-fighting, but one possible method for
            <span class="italic">conducting</span> it. The suppression of
            dissent is just another flavor of imposing an hierarchy of ideas.
            Dr. Despain sums up my reasoning succinctly: “Any process that
            ensures that everyone has a say is good for activist spaces,
            especially since so many coalitions are comprised of people who have
            been silenced.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Silencing disagreement in the name of cooperating towards some
            greater good causes more problems in the long run. It’s misguided at
            best and manipulative at worst. It’s the same mentality that leads
            people to lament that the great tragedy of this moment is
            “divisiveness”, and not, “there are fucking Nazis out in broad
            daylight with the faces G_d gave them because they’re unafraid of
            consequences.”
          </p>
          <p>
            I think as activists on the left (I’m not capitalizing that because
            I don’t believe in some monolithic “Leftism”), it would behoove us
            at all times--but especially this one-- to keep at the forefront of
            our minds Paulo Freire’s four dialogical actions set forth in
            <span class="italic">Pedagogy of the Oppressed:</span> unity,
            compassion, organization, and cultural synthesis.
          </p>
          <p>
            Finally, Theatre of the Oppressed, more than anything else, is about
            recognizing and respecting the humanity in all people-- the absolute
            fullness of that humanity. I close with Cornelio Aguilera’s reminder
            during our discussions:
          </p>
          <p>
            “We have to remember, these ‘antagonists,’ as we’ve been discussing
            them, are also us. Part of the conversation is recognizing when
            <span class="italic">we </span>become them. It’s not simply
            <span class="italic">us</span> against
            <span class="italic">them</span>-- They
            <span class="italic">are</span> us sometimes. [...] It goes back to
            being able to use this, not just for folks who we think need it, but
            for ourselves. ‘Cause we’re all gonna fall down.”
