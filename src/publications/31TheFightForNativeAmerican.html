        The Fight for Native American Equality: Freedom and Justice for All?

          <h3>A Land Stolen From Its People</h3>
          <p>
            When white Europeans landed on the shores of the Americas, all they
            could see was an opportunity to exploit cultures they didn’t
            understand. The land we now call “America” (“America” gets its name
            from one of Columbus’ soldiers, and not even from indigenous
            peoples) was originally home to diverse Native American tribes who
            thrived long before colonizers decided to justify their encroachment
            on native land. Colonizers justified this racially by claiming that
            they were “saving” and “civilizing” the Native people. This
            mentality would later manifest itself as ‘the white man’s burden’.
            Thousands of years before calamitous and destructive colonization
            arrived in the Americas, the Native people had established powerful
            tribal nations that were each individually enriched with sacred
            rituals, beliefs, and complex social structures. We are able to see
            examples of successful Native cultivated life by realizing how
            civilized and accomplished their societies were before colonial
            rule. Indeginous peoples' hygiene was much better than that of the
            colonizers. They were able to build successful long standing
            architecture not only for housing purposes, but also agriculture.
            American textbooks, school curriculums, and ignorant media have
            portrayed Native Americans as either uncivilized and brutal people
            or powerless victims of well-armed Europeans. In reality, Native
            Americans were an extremely diverse group of nations who shared what
            is now the United States, and their cultures became disintegrated
            through the spread of European infectious disease and the systemic
            depletion of natural resources.
          </p>
          <p>
            From the beginning, colonizers had made it their mission to deprive
            the Native people of natural resources, culture, unity, and
            identity. Colonizers have always been extremely harsh and neglectful
            towards Native Americans, ultimately starting from when the first
            treaties (between Natives and colonizers), were broken on the
            colonizers’ part. The Treaty of Canandaigua, signed in 1794, was one
            of the many treaties signed between Natives and the U.S.. This
            treaty had promised a return of more than a million acres of land
            back to Native possession after the Revolutionary War and an annual
            reparation of $4,500 worth of goods. Although the promised provision
            of goods has been honored by the U.S., unfortunately the number of
            acres of land given back to Natives has been significantly decreased
            throughout the years. To put it into perspective, the amount of land
            one reservation occupies is close to 640 acres, which isn’t a lot of
            space for the average 100,000 native occupiers per reservation. Many
            Americans today like to think that these injustices are history and
            that we have learned from our wrong doings. However, Native
            Americans continue to face injustices, often in the form of neglect
            on behalf of the U.S. government.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="row">
          <h3>The Harsh Reality of Life On a Reservation</h3>
          <p>
            When President Andrew Jackson signed the “Indian Removal Act” into
            law on May 28, 1830, Native Americans were forced to move from their
            sacred land to government reserved farm land across the United
            States. Although many tribes went peacefully, others put up a fight,
            mourning over the fact that the land they called home, would no
            longer be theirs. Throughout the removal process, which lasted long
            after Jackson's attempt to move Natives, over 15,000 Indigenous
            peoples died from either exposure to disease, harsh living
            conditions, or starvation.
          </p>
          <p>
            Today, Native American reservations are still very common in the
            United States. Although the media fails to cover reservation life,
            the struggles Native Americans face implemented by the U.S.
            government remain relevant. Most reservations are poor and
            underfunded, leaving Native Americans living on these reservations
            with scarce necessities.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="row">
          <h3>Reforms That Must be Made</h3>
          <p>
            Contrary to popular belief, the systems -designed to help keep
            reservation life as originally promised by the U.S. government- are
            severely underfunded and do little for the Native population.
            Healthcare, technology, and education are particularly underfunded
            on reservations.
          </p>
          <h4>Healthcare</h4>
          <p>
            Compared to other minorities in the U.S., Native Americans are
            provided with insufficient healthcareFaced with challenges due to
            the isolated land reservations lie on, as well as consistently
            underfunded agencies (such as The Indian Health Service, or IHS),
            reservations tend to lack basic healthcare support that is
            inequitable to the rest of the country. A large misconception both
            amongst Natives, and non Natives, is that IHS is a form of health
            insurance that will provide Native Americans free healthcare. The
            truth is that IHS often operates in in-person facilities that lack
            medical technology or certified professionals. They are also
            entitled to decline one’s requests to see a doctor or be treated.
            You might be asking, why can’t Natives simply drive to a hospital
            that isn’t on reservation land? Is that illegal? To put it simply,
            no, it is not illegal, although it is usually very difficult. Not
            only do a majority of Native Americans report feeling discriminated
            against while visiting outside medical centers, but the chance of a
            reservation being close to an outside hospital is low. Because of
            these realities, it’s not difficult to understand why Native
            Americans have a lower life expectancy, and experience higher rates
            of diabetes, cancers, and heart disease.
          </p>
          <h4>Technology</h4>
          <p>
            Since reservations are located on rural land far from larger cities,
            it is a struggle for reservations to be supplied with access to long
            term internet and technology, such as computers, telephones, and
            television sets. To the average person, an understanding of exactly
            why it is so important for Native Americans to have access to
            technology might be hard to understand. Access to technology doesn’t
            seem like a necessary resource in order to stay alive, so why do
            Natives need access to technology?
          </p>
          <p>
            Imagine life on a desolate reservation. You want to provide a better
            life for you and your family, but without access to technology, you
            are unable to apply for food stamps, job applications, and other
            government-issued services for families with low income. In today’s
            world, almost every form or application you can think of has been
            transferred to an online format, and driving hours away to apply for
            services, or jobs in person is unlikely since most Natives living on
            reservations do not have cars or enough money to spend on gas.
            Technology can also be utilized for education on reservations.
            Reservations with limited access to technology are at an increased
            disadvantage compared to other communities that are supplied with
            technology. Access to technology encourages individuals to seek
            higher education, better jobs, and ultimately participate in
            communities as a whole.
          </p>
          <h4>Education</h4>
          <p>
            For Native children growing up on a reservation, finding quality
            education is difficult. As of today, it remains extremely difficult
            to recruit teachers and principals,along with various other school
            staff, to work on a reservation run school. The main reason is that
            it’s either too isolated of a place to work, or it is too
            “difficult”, meaning that most educators expect the poverty and
            at-home problems that face children on reservations to be brought
            into the classroom. Another deterrent is that the salary of a
            teacher typically starts at around 29,000 a year, which is around
            20,000 less than a regular teachers salary. That salary will most
            likely not increase since school funding is incredibly tight on
            reservations, and education resources for Native students continue
            to be underfunded as well. You’re probably wondering why the
            students can’t just enroll in a school outside of their reservation,
            and although that might seem easy enough, driving your child hours
            away to school each day is a major inconvenience for the parents,
            who also need to get to work and try to make a living for their
            family. With limited education funding and the lack of staff, it is
            easier to understand why Native students' graduation rates from
            highschool are roughly 65 percent compared to 75.2 percent of the
            general U.S. population. College graduation rates of Native students
            are even lower, at 9.3 percent, while the general U.S. population
            has an average college graduation rate of 20.3 percent.

          <h3>How to be a Reliable Ally</h3>
          <p>
            In the midst of actively fighting for the reform of Native American
            reservations, we will continue to need your help to consecutively
            move forward! Being a reliable and active ally isn’t just as easy as
            signing a petition and walking away. We need you to keep this
            movement hurling in motion.
          </p>
          <h4>Donations</h4>
          <p>
            A great start to getting involved with Native American reform and
            awareness activism is to donate money to one of the many Native run
            and operated organizations that have been working for years to help
            support the Native people. Some of the ways that these organizations
            help is by providing tribes with material goods such as clothing,
            sometimes housing, food, and other necessities, as well as funding
            for educational resources, elderly care, or even community
            rebuilding. Picking a need that you think should be the most
            supported, and sending donations in that certain direction is always
            encouraged, and a very simple action to take on most websites.
            Nonprofits spend almost all of their time trying to raise money for
            their organization, so even a small donation goes a long way. Below
            is a list of three Native American supporting organizations that you
            can donate to!

          <p>
            Living in the midst of chaos COVID-19 has created within our
            communities, difficult barriers have
            <span class="italic">especially</span> been challenging Native
            students as they pursue a college degree. Quality education for
            cheap is hard to come by without a pandemic present, and you can
            only imagine how much more difficult it has been since. A donation
            to this organization will help guarantee financial tuition support,
            technology, or even rent so that these Native American students will
            have a chance to stay in school, and further achieve their goals.

              >Adopt a Native Elder Program</a
            >
          </h4>
          <p>
            Since the name might be a bit confusing, and to ultimately clear
            things up… no, you don’t actually have to
            <span class="italic">adopt</span> and move in with a Native elder.
            This organization is set up for contributors to fund the older
            generations of Native Americans on reservations that have been
            struggling for decades with food and housing issues. The origins of
            ANEP began about 40 years ago in the 80’s during the chaotic years
            of the Hopi-Navajo land dispute. This dispute catastrophically
            resulted in around 10,000 Navajos being forced into relocation from
            their homelands. Throughout the process, many Navajo Elders were
            facing the most hardships and deprivation due to the fact that
            unemployment and homelessness was a large scale problem. Today, ANEP
            is still actively working hard to support Native Elders with the
            resources that they need for survival.
          </p>
          <h4>Spreading the Word About Native American Issues</h4>
          <p>
            If you were to pay attention when watching the news, reading
            articles, or looking over the trending headlines of today, you would
            easily notice how little the mainstream media reports on Native
            American issues. Indigineous struggles don’t get enough attention as
            other more popularized human rights movements that gain much more
            traction in the media.
          </p>
          <p>
            It has come time for change. Taking the initiative to repost
            informative and <span class="italic">truthful</span>
            articles/resources on your social media platforms is a great way to
            start working towards broader recognition on this topic. Another
            simple way to start spreading the word of Native American reform is
            through petition signing. One of the most utilized online petition
            signing platforms at the moment, is https://www.change.org/. This
            website is host to thousands of petitions for hundreds of different
            topics. By searching what topic you would like to find a petition
            regarding, options will pop up, and you can click accordingly. Some
            key words you can search in order to find petitions regarding Native
            struggles, and pushes to reform are: Native American, American
            Indian, and Indigenous. Signing a petition will only take a few
            seconds being that you simply input your full name and email address
            then click “Sign This Petition”. After signing you can either donate
            a bit of money to help get the petition to the top of the websites
            “Agenda”, or you can share on social media, through text, or email.

          <h4>Supporting Native American Owned Businesses</h4>
          <p>
            Due to the lack of media presence Native Americans currently have,
            it’s not everyday that Native owned businesses are boosted or
            promoted. In a world where most Natives live in poverty, and are
            faced with higher unemployment rates, and housing issues than the
            rest of the country, the crucial search towards support for
            Indeginous owned companies is sought after and highly valued. Native
            owned companies are today’s beautiful preservations of Indiginous
            history, creativity, resilience, and culture. By helping support
            these businesses, you are also supporting the fight for equality
            amongst Native Americans, as well as supporting the rebuild of
            Native economic struggles. Below are three Native owned companies
            that you can support!

            traditional Native American dialect. Founded in 2013, Nanniba Beck

            peoples. The number one piece of Native culture that continues to
            gradually slip away without a sound is traditional language.
            Indeginous traditional language was forced out of Native culture by
            Colonizers who <span class="italic">thought</span>
            they were “civilizing” them as they taught Natives how to speak
