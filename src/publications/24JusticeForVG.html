        How the Death of a Soldier Is Changing the Way People Think of the
        Military
        <h3 class="author">By: Malya Robenson</h3>
      </div>

          <p>
            For the past few months, COVID-19 and the calls for police reform in
            the United States have overshadowed almost everything else in the
            media. The looming pandemic has infected millions globally, and
            tensions over the mistreatment of people of color by the police in
            America have run higher than they’ve been in years. One issue that
            has been struggling to gain media attention is the disappearance and
            death of Private Vanessa Guillen in late April.
          </p>
          <p>
            Twenty-year-old Vanessa Guillen was a United States Army soldier
            from Houston, Texas. She is believed to have been killed on April 22
            at an armory inside of the Fort Hood United States Military Base.
            Her body was found on June 30th, just over two months after the
            incident.
          </p>
          <p>
            Guillen was bludgeoned to death with a hammer by fellow Army
            Specialist Aaron Robinson, who was considered to be a suspect, but
            he committed suicide before he could be taken into police custody.
            His girlfriend, Cecily Aguilar, admitted that she assisted him in
            dismembering Guillen’s body using a machete and attempted to burn
            and dispose of Guillen’s corpse in the woods 20 miles from the base.
            If convicted, she would face up to 20 years in federal prison and
            receive a $250,000 fine.
          </p>
          <p>
            Many believe, however, that Guillen’s murder could’ve been
            prevented. Those who were close to Guillen claim that she had been
            facing sexual harassment by one of her colleagues during the time
            leading up to her death. This has led many to call into question the
            efficacy of the military’s ability to keep its soldiers safe.
          </p>
          <p>
            Although army officials have claimed that there was no evidence of
            Guillen being harassed, Guillen’s family and friends tell a
            different story. They state that she told them numerous times that
            she had felt unsafe at work and that she was being sexually
            harassed. The disparity in their stories probably stems from the
            fact that Guillen didn’t report the harassment, likely because she
            felt as if she couldn’t, either because she believed she wouldn’t be
            listened to or because she feared retaliation.
          </p>
          <p>
            The United States military has historically had an incredibly poor
            track record when it comes to addressing sexual harassment. In far
            too many cases, they cover up any transgressions on their part,
            choosing to punish women for speaking out rather than confronting
            the issues. Women often feel as if they shouldn’t speak out against
            their harassers because they fear being discredited or ridiculed. As
            a result, victims believe that staying quiet is the only right
            option.
          </p>
          <p>
            One of such women is Arizona Republican Senator, Martha McSally, who
            served in the Air Force for over two decades. She was raped by a
            superior officer but stayed quiet about the incident for years
            because she was scared that the system wouldn’t protect her,
            especially because of the rank of her assailant. Instead, she chose
            to live with the intense fear and shame for years.
          </p>
          <p>
            Reports from the Department of Defense’s Sexual Assault Prevention
            and Response Office have found that in 2018, 6.3% of active-duty men
            and 24.2% of active-duty women had been sexually harassed. One-fifth
            of women who had been sexually harassed were also sexually
            assaulted.
          </p>
          <p>
            The office also found that 76.1% of victims of sexual assault did
            not report it, likely because 64% of those who do report the
            incidents face some form of retaliation such as demotion in work
            assignments, being denied promotions or deployment, lower
            performance evaluations, and even complete discharge. Of those who
            do face retaliation, 66% receive said retaliation from their chain
            of command, and about a third are discharged.
          </p>
          <p>
            With statistics so staggering, it is no wonder that women are so
            terrified of speaking up.
          </p>
          <p>
            Guillen’s family and others who have heard of their situation are
            seeking justice for Vanessa as well as reform in the way that the
            military addresses and handles sexual assault cases. They hope that
            what happened to Vanessa won’t happen to any other soldier.
          </p>
          <p>
            From the day that Guillen disappeared, it was clear to her family
            that the military was mishandling the case and that proper protocols
            were not being followed. They believe that her disappearance was not
            being taken seriously and that it took them far too long to get
            answers.
          </p>
          <p>
            The general consensus of the public is that women, especially women
            of color, are being mistreated and discriminated against by the
            military. The League of United Latin American Citizens is
            discouraging Latina women from joining the military since it does a
            poor job of protecting those enlisted.
          </p>
          <p>
            The hashtag #IamVanessaGuillen has been gaining steam recently as
            men and women who were in the military share their stories of
            harassment and assault.
          </p>
          <p>
            Vanessa Guillen was a bright young individual with great potential.
            Her parents have said that since she was a child, Vanessa wanted to
            be in the army so she could protect her country. Her sister leads
            the fray as thousands across the nation have gone to the streets in
            protest to demand radical change.
          </p>
          <p>
            Vanessa was an ambitious soldier who had her future stolen from her.
            Her story deserves to be told in every capacity. Coverage of the
            developments in her case have been light at best, and the media
            largely chooses to ignore the ongoing protests in her name. She
            cannot become just another statistic. Her name must not get lost in
            an endless sea of failures on the part of the supposed strongest
            military in the world. Say her name.
