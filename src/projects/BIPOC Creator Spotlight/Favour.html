            1. Introduce yourself!
          </h4>
        </div>
        <p>
          I was born in Lagos, Nigeria and moved to the United States at age 6. I attend a school in South Central Los
          Angeles and I’m a junior there. I enjoy playing soccer, reading, writing, and watching Criminal Minds. I am a
          Leo!
        </p>

        <div class="row">
          <h4 class="mohogany">
            2. How have you identified yourself as a BIPOC individual through your creative work?
          </h4>
        </div>
        <p>
          The poetry I write is usually from a first person point of view and I use my identity as a Black person to
          express emotions that are felt by many BIPOC as a result of the way we are treated in this country.
        </p>

        <div class="row">
          <h4 class="mohogany">
            3. How has your creative work allowed you to express yourself?
          </h4>
        </div>
        <p>
          My creative work has allowed me to express awareness about certain issues because I’ve written about struggles
          that Black people face and struggles that women face and those issues (sexism, racism, misogynoir) matter to
          me a lot, especially as a young Black woman. I’ve used my poetry to express anger and pain but also to uplift
          these oppressed groups.
        </p>

        <div class="row">
          <h4 class="mohogany">
            4. What is your stance on BIPOC representation in the media?
          </h4>
        </div>
        <p>
          I feel that representation of BIPOC in media has a long way to go to be considered accurate. I feel that the
          way these groups are represented is based mainly on Euro-centric views of the way BIPOC act, talk, live, etc.
          and media needs to abstain from enforcing harmful beliefs and stereotypes about BIPOC.
        </p>

        <div class="row">
          <h4 class="mohogany">
            5. How has your culture influenced your work and who you are today?
          </h4>
        </div>
        <p>
          My culture as a Nigerian has influenced my work because it has helped me to know firsthand how it feels to be
          harmed by the issues I write about. I’m also more skeptical of cultural practices around the world and more
          able to recognize how they might be enforcing racist, sexist, classist, or other harmful ideologies.
        </p>

        <div class="row">
          <h4 class="mohogany">
            6. What do you like to do in your free time?
          </h4>
        </div>
        <div class="spacing">
          <p>
            In my free time, I enjoy listening to music, reading, eating, and watching TED Talks or Netflix (depending
            on what kind of day it is).
