            Boy the difference between your sex and mind is ours drips off our body differently.<br><br>
            There is more fluidity, the color scheme is queer and wayward child,<br><br>
            time folded over itself and shot itself through the center to lead a path from the forward to the now<br><br>
            presently, undaunting<br><br>
            Take me across borders, finding seclusion from the bridges of homo-matrimony<br><br>
            Crucify me with jagged crosses,<br><br>
            hot glamorous Oligarchy holding hands with the sins of a million discreet minions<br><br>
            Finding it sad I cannot bow to see my deceased love ones once again and again<br><br>
            The ghost of the past come back to hold hands with grandmothers bed side terrors<br><br>
            Screaming in the mirror to reassure you can see yourself feel<br><br>
            robes and hoods walking into the room<br><br>
            Figure you were never really here to begin with<br><br>
            Slip away into the chair<br><br>
            Moonlit angry simmers here<br><br>
            Imploding into fear<br><br>
            Seeking truth as you bear a diamond out of your rear<br><br>
            Nothing as it was and can ever be<br><br>
            Seeds inside me<br><br>

            <h3>How does your work connect to the BLM movement or systemic racism?</h3>
            <p class="italic">
                The strings which attach my work to the systematic racism that politicizes my body are tethered. In my poetry, I often find myself "freestyling" through my hands onto the keyboard or into the pen. Where the reality of alienation and gravity of oppression sinks itself into my words. It's one of the only mediums in which I can have a dialogue with my blood and my history primordially. Within the last three years, my family and I have lost six of our loved ones, nearly all were tragic. Most recently COVID-19 took the lives of my Grandpa and Uncle Jose. At 20 years old, meditating with mourning and melancholia has never felt more valuable. From an even larger picture, between viruses and bureaucratic brutality, it feels as if grief is an inescapable truth of black consciousness. A truth which has touched my life deeply in the these last quick years of youth. Although, within my infatuation with death I find an undaunting certainty at the end of my imagination. My writing allows me to weave and work through these issues as new traumas present themselves to me through technology, grief, and time.
