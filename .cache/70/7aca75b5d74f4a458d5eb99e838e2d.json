The land we now call “America” (“America” gets its name\r\n            from one of Columbus’ soldiers, and not even from indigenous\r\n            peoples) was originally home to diverse Native American tribes who\r\n            thrived long before colonizers decided to justify their encroachment\r\n            on native land. Colonizers justified this racially by claiming that\r\n            they were “saving” and “civilizing” the Native people. This\r\n            mentality would later manifest itself as ‘the white man’s burden’.\r\n            Thousands of years before calamitous and destructive colonization\r\n            arrived in the Americas, the Native people had established powerful\r\n            tribal nations that were each individually enriched with sacred\r\n            rituals, beliefs, and complex social structures. We are able to see\r\n            examples of successful Native cultivated life by realizing how\r\n            civilized and accomplished their societies were before colonial\r\n            rule. Indeginous peoples' hygiene was much better than that of the\r\n            colonizers. They were able to build successful long standing\r\n            architecture not only for housing purposes, but also agriculture.\r\n            American textbooks, school curriculums, and ignorant media have\r\n            portrayed Native Americans as either uncivilized and brutal people\r\n            or powerless victims of well-armed Europeans. In reality, Native\r\n            Americans were an extremely diverse group of nations who shared what\r\n            is now the United States, and their cultures became disintegrated\r\n            through the spread of European infectious disease and the systemic\r\n            depletion of natural resources.\r\n          </p>\r\n          <p>\r\n            From the beginning, colonizers had made it their mission to deprive\r\n            the Native people of natural resources, culture, unity, and\r\n            identity. Colonizers have always been extremely harsh and neglectful\r\n            towards Native Americans, ultimately starting from when the first\r\n            treaties (between Natives and colonizers), were broken on the\r\n            colonizers’ part. The Treaty of Canandaigua, signed in 1794, was one\r\n            of the many treaties signed between Natives and the U.S.. This\r\n            treaty had promised a return of more than a million acres of land\r\n            back to Native possession after the Revolutionary War and an annual\r\n            reparation of $4,500 worth of goods. Although the promised provision\r\n            of goods has been honored by the U.S., unfortunately the number of\r\n            acres of land given back to Natives has been significantly decreased\r\n            throughout the years. To put it into perspective, the amount of land\r\n            one reservation occupies is close to 640 acres, which isn’t a lot of\r\n            space for the average 100,000 native occupiers per reservation. Many\r\n            Americans today like to think that these injustices are history and\r\n            that we have learned from our wrong doings. However, Native\r\n            Americans continue to face injustices, often in the form of neglect\r\n            on behalf of the U.S. government.\r\n          </p>\r\n        </div>\r\n        <div class=\"row\">\r\n          <h3>The Harsh Reality of Life On a Reservation</h3>\r\n          <p>\r\n            When President Andrew Jackson signed the “Indian Removal Act” into\r\n            law on May 28, 1830, Native Americans were forced to move from their\r\n            sacred land to government reserved farm land across the United\r\n            States. Although many tribes went peacefully, others put up a fight,\r\n            mourning over the fact that the land they called home, would no\r\n            longer be theirs. Throughout the removal process, which lasted long\r\n            after Jackson's attempt to move Natives, over 15,000 Indigenous\r\n            peoples died from either exposure to disease, harsh living\r\n            conditions, or starvation.\r\n          </p>\r\n          <p>\r\n            Today, Native American reservations are still very common in the\r\n            United States. Although the media fails to cover reservation life,\r\n            the struggles Native Americans face implemented by the U.S.\r\n            government remain relevant. Most reservations are poor and\r\n            underfunded, leaving Native Americans living on these reservations\r\n            with scarce necessities.\r\n          </p>\r\n        </div>\r\n        <div class=\"row\">\r\n          <h3>Reforms That Must be Made</h3>\r\n          <p>\r\n            Contrary to popular belief, the systems -designed to help keep\r\n            reservation life as originally promised by the U.S. government- are\r\n            severely underfunded and do little for the Native population.\r\n            Healthcare, technology, and education are particularly underfunded\r\n            on reservations.\r\n          </p>\r\n          <h4>Healthcare</h4>\r\n          <p>\r\n            Compared to other minorities in the U.S., Native Americans are\r\n            provided with insufficient healthcareFaced with challenges due to\r\n            the isolated land reservations lie on, as well as consistently\r\n            underfunded agencies (such as The Indian Health Service, or IHS),\r\n            reservations tend to lack basic healthcare support that is\r\n            inequitable to the rest of the country. A large misconception both\r\n            amongst Natives, and non Natives, is that IHS is a form of health\r\n            insurance that will provide Native Americans free healthcare. The\r\n            truth is that IHS often operates in in-person facilities that lack\r\n            medical technology or certified professionals. They are also\r\n            entitled to decline one’s requests to see a doctor or be treated.\r\n            You might be asking, why can’t Natives simply drive to a hospital\r\n            that isn’t on reservation land? Is that illegal? To put it simply,\r\n            no, it is not illegal, although it is usually very difficult. Not\r\n            only do a majority of Native Americans report feeling discriminated\r\n            against while visiting outside medical centers, but the chance of a\r\n            reservation being close to an outside hospital is low. Because of\r\n            these realities, it’s not difficult to understand why Native\r\n            Americans have a lower life expectancy, and experience higher rates\r\n            of diabetes, cancers, and heart disease.\r\n          </p>\r\n          <h4>Technology</h4>\r\n          <p>\r\n            Since reservations are located on rural land far from larger cities,\r\n            it is a struggle for reservations to be supplied with access to long\r\n            term internet and technology, such as computers, telephones, and\r\n            television sets. To the average person, an understanding of exactly\r\n            why it is so important for Native Americans to have access to\r\n            technology might be hard to understand. Access to technology doesn’t\r\n            seem like a necessary resource in order to stay alive, so why do\r\n            Natives need access to technology?\r\n          </p>\r\n          <p>\r\n            Imagine life on a desolate reservation. You want to provide a better\r\n            life for you and your family, but without access to technology, you\r\n            are unable to apply for food stamps, job applications, and other\r\n            government-issued services for families with low income. In today’s\r\n            world, almost every form or application you can think of has been\r\n            transferred to an online format, and driving hours away to apply for\r\n            services, or jobs in person is unlikely since most Natives living on\r\n            reservations do not have cars or enough money to spend on gas.\r\n            Technology can also be utilized for education on reservations.\r\n            Reservations with limited access to technology are at an increased\r\n            disadvantage compared to other communities that are supplied with\r\n            technology. Access to technology encourages individuals to seek\r\n            higher education, better jobs, and ultimately participate in\r\n            communities as a whole.\r\n          </p>\r\n          <h4>Education</h4>\r\n          <p>\r\n            For Native children growing up on a reservation, finding quality\r\n            education is difficult. As of today, it remains extremely difficult\r\n            to recruit teachers and principals,along with various other school\r\n            staff, to work on a reservation run school. The main reason is that\r\n            it’s either too isolated of a place to work, or it is too\r\n            “difficult”, meaning that most educators expect the poverty and\r\n            at-home problems that face children on reservations to be brought\r\n            into the classroom. Another deterrent is that the salary of a\r\n            teacher typically starts at around 29,000 a year, which is around\r\n            20,000 less than a regular teachers salary. That salary will most\r\n            likely not increase since school funding is incredibly tight on\r\n            reservations, and education resources for Native students continue\r\n            to be underfunded as well. You’re probably wondering why the\r\n            students can’t just enroll in a school outside of their reservation,\r\n            and although that might seem easy enough, driving your child hours\r\n            away to school each day is a major inconvenience for the parents,\r\n            who also need to get to work and try to make a living for their\r\n            family. With limited education funding and the lack of staff, it is\r\n            easier to understand why Native students' graduation rates from\r\n            highschool are roughly 65 percent compared to 75.2 percent of the\r\n            general U.S. population. College graduation rates of Native students\r\n            are even lower, at 9.3 percent, while the general U.S. population\r\n            has an average college graduation rate of 20.3 percent.\r\n          </p>\r\n        </div>\r\n        <div class=\"row\">\r\n          <h3>How to be a Reliable Ally</h3>\r\n          <p>\r\n            In the midst of actively fighting for the reform of Native American\r\n            reservations, we will continue to need your help to consecutively\r\n            move forward! Being a reliable and active ally isn’t just as easy as\r\n            signing a petition and walking away. We need you to keep this\r\n            movement hurling in motion.\r\n          </p>\r\n          <h4>Donations</h4>\r\n          <p>\r\n            A great start to getting involved with Native American reform and\r\n            awareness activism is to donate money to one of the many Native run\r\n            and operated organizations that have been working for years to help\r\n            support the Native people. Some of the ways that these organizations\r\n            help is by providing tribes with material goods such as clothing,\r\n            sometimes housing, food, and other necessities, as well as funding\r\n            for educational resources, elderly care, or even community\r\n            rebuilding. Picking a need that you think should be the most\r\n            supported, and sending donations in that certain direction is always\r\n            encouraged, and a very simple action to take on most websites.\r\n            Nonprofits spend almost all of their time trying to raise money for\r\n            their organization, so even a small donation goes a long way. Below\r\n            is a list of three Native American supporting organizations that you\r\n            can donate to!\r\n          </p>\r\n          <h4 class=\"publicationLink\">\r\n            <a href=\"https://engage.collegefund.org/page/19064/donate/1?ea.tracking.id=standsite\">The American Indian College Fund</a>\r\n          </h4>\r\n          <p>\r\n            Living in the midst of chaos COVID-19 has created within our\r\n            communities, difficult barriers have\r\n            <span class=\"italic\">especially</span> been challenging Native\r\n            students as they pursue a college degree. Quality education for\r\n            cheap is hard to come by without a pandemic present, and you can\r\n            only imagine how much more difficult it has been since. A donation\r\n            to this organization will help guarantee financial tuition support,\r\n            technology, or even rent so that these Native American students will\r\n            have a chance to stay in school, and further achieve their goals.\r\n          </p>\r\n          <h4 class=\"publicationLink\">\r\n            <a href=\"https://anelder.org/giving/donation\">Adopt a Native Elder Program</a>\r\n          </h4>\r\n          <p>\r\n            Since the name might be a bit confusing, and to ultimately clear\r\n            things up… no, you don’t actually have to\r\n            <span class=\"italic\">adopt</span> and move in with a Native elder.\r\n            This organization is set up for contributors to fund the older\r\n            generations of Native Americans on reservations that have been\r\n            struggling for decades with food and housing issues. The origins of\r\n            ANEP began about 40 years ago in the 80’s during the chaotic years\r\n            of the Hopi-Navajo land dispute. This dispute catastrophically\r\n            resulted in around 10,000 Navajos being forced into relocation from\r\n            their homelands. Throughout the process, many Navajo Elders were\r\n            facing the most hardships and deprivation due to the fact that\r\n            unemployment and homelessness was a large scale problem. Today, ANEP\r\n            is still actively working hard to support Native Elders with the\r\n            resources that they need for survival.\r\n          </p>\r\n          <h4>Spreading the Word About Native American Issues</h4>\r\n          <p>\r\n            If you were to pay attention when watching the news, reading\r\n            articles, or looking over the trending headlines of today, you would\r\n            easily notice how little the mainstream media reports on Native\r\n            American issues. Indigineous struggles don’t get enough attention as\r\n            other more popularized human rights movements that gain much more\r\n            traction in the media.\r\n          </p>\r\n          <p>\r\n            It has come time for change. Taking the initiative to repost\r\n            informative and <span class=\"italic\">truthful</span>\r\n            articles/resources on your social media platforms is a great way to\r\n            start working towards broader recognition on this topic. Another\r\n            simple way to start spreading the word of Native American reform is\r\n            through petition signing. One of the most utilized online petition\r\n            signing platforms at the moment, is https://www.change.org/. This\r\n            website is host to thousands of petitions for hundreds of different\r\n            topics. By searching what topic you would like to find a petition\r\n            regarding, options will pop up, and you can click accordingly. Some\r\n            key words you can search in order to find petitions regarding Native\r\n            struggles, and pushes to reform are: Native American, American\r\n            Indian, and Indigenous.

In a world where most Natives live in poverty, and are\r\n            faced with higher unemployment rates, and housing issues than the\r\n            rest of the country, the crucial search towards support for\r\n            Indeginous owned companies is sought after and highly valued. Native\r\n            owned companies are today’s beautiful preservations of Indiginous\r\n            history, creativity, resilience, and culture. By helping support\r\n            these businesses, you are also supporting the fight for equality\r\n            amongst Native Americans, as well as supporting the rebuild of\r\n            Native economic struggles. Below are three Native owned companies\r\n            that you can support!\r\n          </p>\r\n          <h4 class=\"publicationLink\">\r\n            <a href=\"https://trickstercompany.com/\">Trickster Company</a>\r\n          </h4>\r\n          <p>\r\n            This company's active and lively attire is designed by Native\r\n            artists whose goals are to integrate traditional Indeginous designs\r\n            into a modern and innovative setting. Ranging from skateboards,\r\n            jewelry, clothing and home goods, at reasonable prices, this company\r\n            basically has it all. Their work has been featured in the Anchorage\r\n            Museum, the Burke Museum, and the Museum Of the North.\r\n          </p>\r\n          <h4 class=\"publicationLink\">\r\n            <a href=\"https://bedrechocolates.com/\">Bedre Fine Chocolate</a>\r\n          </h4>\r\n          <p>\r\n            Over four decades ago near Ada, Oklahoma, Bedre Fine Chocolate began\r\n            its journey starting as a small chocolatier. In the year 2000, the\r\n            Chickasaw Nation found opportunity in the chocolate company, and\r\n            eventually bought it, ultimately passionate to produce the best\r\n            quality chocolate they could. Now, working out of Salt Lake city\r\n            Utah, Bedre takes it’s time to give back to the Chicksaw people by\r\n            contributing to Native education and health programs helping to\r\n            better their community.\r\n          </p>\r\n          <h4 class=\"publicationLink\">\r\n            <a href=\"https://notabove.com/shop\">NotAbove</a>\r\n          </h4>\r\n          <p>\r\n            This company centers itself around jewelry making that incorporates\r\n            traditional Native American dialect. Founded in 2013, Nanniba Beck\r\n            made it her goal to create minimalistic yet beautifully crafted\r\n            jewelry that is meant to elevate the falling culture of Indigineous\r\n            peoples. The number one piece of Native culture that continues to\r\n            gradually slip away without a sound is traditional language.\r\n            Indeginous traditional language was forced out of Native culture by\r\n            Colonizers who <span class=\"italic\">thought</span>\r\n            they were “civilizing” them as they taught Natives how to speak\r\n            english and only english. With a loss of dialect comes a loss of\r\n            culture, identity, and faith. Nanniba does her best to preserve\r\n            Native traditional spoken culture through the art of jewelry making.\r\n            She hand makes her one of a kind jewelry “among the cacti'' of\r\n            Southern Arizona.\r\n          </p>\r\n        </div>\r\n        <div class=\"row\"></div>\r\n      </div>\r\n    </div>\r\n\r\n    <section id=\"footer\"></section>\r\n    <script src=\"/42f69825340f0b5fa628d80900a46daa.js\"></script>\r\n  </body>\r\n</html>\r\n"},"sourceMaps":null,"error":null,"hash":"f8bbc764bf5cfeb5aa5493c51ca1a5db","cacheData":{"env":{}}}
