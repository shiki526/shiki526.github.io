He looks like he is leaving the house very quietly. Almost escaping like he is a 15-year old boy, but he is clearly in his 30s. He looks at his phone waiting for someone and he seems to be annoyed. When 'BOOM' and massive earthquake hits.<br><br> GABRIEL ALEXIS Oh fuck! The earthquake ends. <br><br> GABRIEL ALEXIS Ma! Pa! Silence.<br><br> GABRIEL ALEXIS Ma! Pa!<br><br> GABRIEL ALEXIS is in terror. <br><br> GABRIEL ALEXIS Pa!<br><br> DON GABRIEL (O.S.) We are coming down. No worries.<br><br> DOÑA MARTA and DON GABRIEL enter. <br><br> DOÑA MARTA This thing almost killed us honey!<br><br> GABRIEL ALEXIS You guys scared me! You would not answer.<br><br> DOÑA MARTA Why are you dressed up? Were you up already? <br><br> 3. <br><br> GABRIEL ALEXIS Nah, I got dressed fast. This is my mom. I always think of her as a superhero. Her superpower? Praying and caring. She is the bad ass that she will make all my drunken uncles pray during a party. She will always pick the most \"lit\" moment of the party to make everyone pray. People feel very assured by people that pray. Years ago, our neighbor, Don Papo, had a massive heart attack. He died on his living room. His wife called 911 and immediately after, she sent for my mom. My mom, my superhero... she will now pray.<br><br> DONA MARTA whips out her rosary like it is Wonder Woman's whip. <br><br> DON GABRIEL There you go.<br><br> DON GABRIEL hands GABRIEL A. a flashlight, <br><br>DON GABRIEL has many gadgets. <br><br>DON GABRIEL, a true prep-er, has been ready for this. <br><br> GABRIEL ALEXIS Dad: he thrives in these situations. You will see how ready he is for all of this.<br><br> Enters JUDITH. <br><br>JUDITH is completely out of control from her Earthquake experience. <br><br> JUDITH Ay Dios mio!! Ay Ay Ay Ay Tu no puedes enterder que ese terremoto por poco me mata. Todo se movía tan y tan fuerte y sonaba TA CA TA CA TA CA TACA y yo Dios mio, pero que esto. Qué es esto? No me dió tiempo de cambiarme, yo me 4ire por esas escaleras... y como que no llegaba.. ay ay ay AAAAAYYY Are you Gabrielito? I thought you were your Dad! And look at you!! You are not fat anymore.<br><br> Everyone stops moving. <br><br> GABRIEL ALEXIS<br><br> Please take a seat Miss Judith.<br><br> Enter JOSE ALBERTO. <br><br> JOSE ALBERTO Auntie Judith! What the hell?<br><br> GABRIEL ALEXIS Look who is not dead. <br><br> 4. <br><br> JUDITH (as JUDITH faints) Ay nene!<br><br> JOSE ALBERTO Can we talk about this later?<br><br> GABRIEL ALEXIS Sure.<br><br> JOSE ALBERTO (referring to JUDITH) What is wrong with her?<br><br> GABRIEL ALEXIS I don't know, maybe she just had a life-threatening experience... or maybe she was waiting on her date to show up and she got tired of waiting!<br><br> JOSE ALBERTO Can you stop being so gay in front of everybody?<br><br> GABRIEL ALEXIS Excuse me Miss Puerto Rico 1954!<br><br> JOSE ALBERTO Here we go again. I'm going to check on Auntie Judith. I will deal with you later.<br><br> GABRIEL ALEXIS You will deal with me if I let you deal with me. Honey, I am half princess Leia, half Rita Moreno, so don't. Fuck. With. Me.<br><br> DON GABRIEL Gabo? All good?<br><br> GABRIEL ALEXIS Yes Dad.<br><br> DON GABRIEL opens a beer. <br><br> DOÑA MARTA Are you going to start drinking right now? We just had an earthquake!<br><br> DON GABRIEL I can't think of a better excuse to start drinking. Cheers! <br><br> 5. <br><br> GABRIEL ALEXIS (TO THE AUDIENCE.) My Dad. You will think he is a drunk/alcoholic. Well you are right. I love him though. He is the most organized, prepared and loving dad a person can ever have. In fact, my dad was so prepared, that he was so eager for me to come-out of the closet. Here we are building the terrace of this very house. Mutis of working on the construction the terrace<br><br> DON GABRIEL and GABRIEL ALEXIS. <br><br> DON GABRIEL Hey son, is there anything you want to tell me?<br><br> GABRIEL ALEXIS About what?<br><br> DON GABRIEL Well you know about anything.<br><br> GABRIEL ALEXIS Oh, ohhh. No, I am good.<br><br> GABRIEL ALEXIS (BACK TO THE PRESENT) We had that same conversation around seven more times over the years, but I had plans for my coming out event. I did it during one of my plays. I mean, why waste an opportunity to make some art! My dad loved it... my mom not so much.<br><br> DON GABRIEL Gabo don't be writing about this in one of your plays.<br><br> GABRIEL ALEXIS Never!<br><br> DOÑA MARTA Unless you can get Rita Moreno to play me.<br><br> DON GABRIEL Yeah, like I have Rita Moreno-money. Or any money at all.<br><br> DON GABRIEL (TO THE AUDIENCE.) \"Nobody is gayer than my son!\"<br><br> GABRIEL ALEXIS Dad please not now!<br><br> DON GABRIEL I loved that play. It was good. My son: the Hollywood actor! <br><br> 6. <br><br> DOÑA JUDITH Con lo gordo que era antes! So fat... Remember?<br><br> GABRIEL ALEXIS And the dead arise!<br><br> DON GABRIEL hands GABRIEL ALEXIS a beer. GABRIEL ALEXIS opens the beer.<br><br> DOÑA MARTA Gabriel Alexis! What are you doing?<br><br> GABRIEL ALEXIS Mom, I don't want the beers to go bad!<br><br> Enter JOSE ALBERTO. <br><br> JOSE ALBERTO Gabby, can we talk?<br><br> DON GABRIEL gives both of them little flashlights. <br><br> GABRIEL ALEXIS Sure. Buckle up everybody!<br><br> JOSE ALBERTO I am so sorry about that.<br><br> GABRIEL ALEXIS What? You are sorry the I did not have sex right before the earthquake? That is not the problem, the problem is that you just did not show up!<br><br> JOSE ALBERTO Look at the bright side.<br><br> GABRIEL ALEXIS There is a bright side in being flaked-on?<br><br> JOSE ALBERTO We would have been doing it in the middle of the earthquake.<br><br> GABRIEL ALEXIS You think we would be having sex for over an hour? Someone is really looking at the bright side.<br><br> JOSE ALBERTO I thought you wanted to get back together and I freaked out. <br><br> 7. <br><br> GABRIEL ALEXIS What in gay hell signaled that? We were meeting at 4am to get a room that you pay by the hour. That does not signal \"getting back together\" unless you are a lesbian.<br><br> JOSE ALBERTO And I just got divorced...<br><br> GABRIEL ALEXIS Look Sophy's Choice, I only wanted us to have some fun for old time sake. You are going back to Florida and I am going back to LA soon. So please spare me of the Noah's Arc re-run, Miss Liza Minelli.<br><br> JOSE ALBERTO Jesus! How many gay references are you going to use in one sentence!<br><br> GABRIEL ALEXIS As many as I can fit it! Unlike you, I am not ashamed of being part of the LGBT+ community.<br><br> JOSE ALBERTO I am not gay!<br><br> GABRIEL ALEXIS Of course not, you are bi!<br><br> JOSE ALBERTO No, I am not. You are the only man I ever been with!<br><br> GABRIEL ALEXIS What the fuck?<br><br> JOSE ALBERTO It is true, I have never been attracted to other men.<br><br> GABRIEL ALEXIS I know you are trying to be sweet, but I think you are fooling yourself.<br><br> JOSE ALBERTO How?<br><br> GABRIEL ALEXIS So, you are telling me, that you are at the gym locker room, and a really hot guy walks in and undresses and has a huge dick and a nice ass, you do not look and you are not attracted at all. <br><br> 8. <br><br> JOSE ALBERTO Well, I can't say that, but I feel different about you.<br><br> GABRIEL ALEXIS That does not mean that you are not attracted to men. You are in love with me.<br><br> JOSE ALBERTO Nah, please.<br><br> GABRIEL ALEXIS Do not get full of yourself. I know you love me, because I love you too. I thought you knew that.<br><br> JOSE ALBERTO Wow, that's a lot of information.<br><br> GABRIEL ALEXIS No, it is not. So, Joe, you have never hooked up with a rando,or go on an awful date to the gay club or Netflix and chill with a \"buddy?\"<br><br> JOSE ALBERTO Not really. I don't really ever done the gay-scene.<br><br> GABRIEL ALEXIS Oh dear. Joe, you have been suppressing an important part of yourself with that...<br><br> DOÑA MARTA Everyone! I think it is a good time for us to pray.<br><br> GABRIEL ALEXIS Mom! We just prayed; it is not a good time. DOÑA MARTA (LOVING.) That prayer already expired honey, we need to do another one.<br><br> GABRIEL ALEXIS If that prayer expired, what are we going to do? Be praying all day long?<br><br> DOÑA MARTA ...and that will be okay.<br><br> GABRIEL ALEXIS It is not like that is helping.<br><br> DOÑA MARTA Excuse you sir! Prayers kept us alive. What do you think <br><br> 9. <br><br> did? The government? After the Hurricane, we were left off to fence for ourselves. We had to rescue the few people that we could by ourselves. Do you think the Puerto Rican government did anything? They were out to get all they could steal. How about the United States of America? That aid arrived here last week! Two years later! What a shame! Our people served on every war that the White men had. However, they did not come when it was our time of need. Don't you tell me that prayer is not helping! Prayer is the only thing we got! Our prayers kept us alive!<br><br> GABRIEL ALEXIS You told me you guys were okay.<br><br> DOÑA MARTA Nobody could help honey. We were stocked in this island and the bodies were piling up. What use could it have done to tell you?<br><br> GABRIEL ALEXIS I am so sorry mom. I'll be there in second. GABRIEL ALEXIS goes to JOSE ALBERTO. A strong aftershock is felt/hear. GABRIEL ALEXIS and JOSE ALBERTO kiss passionately. Everyone stops and watch.<br><br> DOÑA MARTA (TO JOSÉ ALBERTO) Don't worry honey, we all know.<br><br> JOSE ALBERTO What? Since when?<br><br> DON GABRIEL Since you were both little.<br><br> GABRIEL ALEXIS Go check on your parents okay? Oh... and take Auntie Judith. Please.<br><br> JOSE ALBERTO Okay.<br><br> JOSE ALBERTO and GABRIEL ALEXIS give each other a peck.<br><br> DON GABRIEL I do have engagement rings for you two. I bought ten years ago. Just let me know if you want them. <br><br> 10. <br><br> GABRIEL ALEXIS Oh dear. Dad stop! A beat.<br><br> GABRIEL ALEXIS Mom, can we pray?<br><br> DOÑA MARTA Of course, nene. Come here.<br><br> GABRIEL ALEXIS sits right next to his mom she grabs his hand and she is carrying her rosary in the other hand. She starts praying. <br><br>DON GABRIEL grabs two beers hands one to GABRIEL ALEXIS.<br><br> LAST IMAGE: GABRIEL ALEXIS is praying while grabbing his mom's hand and a beer on the other hand. <br><br>DON GABRIEL stands right next to him having his beer and watching over them two. <br><br> -The End- </p> </div> <div class=\"row\"> <h3>How does your work connect to the BLM movement or systemic racism?</h3> <p class=\"italic\"> I work doing academic studies of the lack of inclusion in theatre education and media.
