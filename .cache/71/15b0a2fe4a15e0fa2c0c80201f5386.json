Yet, many Asian Americans have experienced\r\n            a recent surge in racist attacks due to the novel coronavirus\r\n            outbreak. Hostile attitudes toward Asian Americans aren’t new.\r\n            “There’s a long history of blaming Asia and Asian migrants and, by\r\n            extension, Asian Americans for outbreaks of disease. COVID-19 is\r\n            just the most current example of this history,” stated Cathy Ceniza\r\n            Choy for the Berkeley News at the University of California.\r\n          </p>\r\n        </div>\r\n        <div class=\"row\">\r\n          <p>\r\n            Along with the fear of the spread, COVID-19 has also given rise to\r\n            harassment and many racist remarks against Asian Americans across\r\n            the United States. President Donald Trump has called COVID-19 the\r\n            “Chinese virus” and the “Kung flu”. Trump stated at a White House\r\n            press conference that the coronavirus could have been stopped in\r\n            Wuhan, China, where the first case of COVID-19 was discovered. It is\r\n            unethical for someone with high authority to criticize a certain\r\n            group of people. After her classmate said Chinese people are\r\n            “disgusting” and “dirty,” Katherine Oung, a teenager in Florida,\r\n            told the New York Times, “As the coronavirus spreads, there’s\r\n            another virus spreading that we need to be talking about.” Many\r\n            Asian Americans are being bombarded with hateful racist comments\r\n            from many of their peers and community members. Many Asian\r\n            Americans, including myself, who live in Detroit, are anxious about\r\n            being targeted by coronavirus racism. Last month, the Detroit Free\r\n            Press reported “an elderly Chinese American had his grocery cart\r\n            spat on by someone.”\r\n          </p>\r\n        </div>\r\n        <div class=\"row\">\r\n          <p>\r\n            As a result, UNICEF has declared Yemen’s ongoing dissension as the\r\n            world’s largest humanitarian crisis. Ignorance is the stagnation of\r\n            innovative solutions, which is why recognizing and working towards\r\n            alleviating Yemen’s humanitarian crisis through social media\r\n            activism, online articles, and word of mouth is of utmost\r\n            importance. Specifically considering social media, it can be a\r\n            vessel to transform knowledge into tangible action: sharing accurate\r\n            information, linking petitions, donations and valid newsreels can\r\n            help educate, empathize and create opportunities for the youth to\r\n            strive for social justice. Often, constant exposure to news on\r\n            social media allows individuals to take the conversation beyond an\r\n            app, into the confines of their home and communities, especially if\r\n            the issue has not been addressed in the media. Sadly, the Yemen\r\n            crisis does not get NEARLY enough media coverage that it deserves,\r\n            as #BlackLivesMatter is a current focal point (as it should be, but\r\n            we need to prioritize Yemen too). Therefore, please read the\r\n            following article and inform yourselves: and do your part in\r\n            donating, and sharing accurate information over social media.\r\n          </p>\r\n        </div>\r\n        <div class=\"row\">\r\n          The coronavirus is spreading rapidly, and so is discrimination against\r\n          Asians. It is a difficult time for everyone. Many people are feeling\r\n          frustrated and angry, but it’s important to respect every group\r\n          despite the generalizations that are being made about certain races.\r\n        </div>\r\n        <div class=\"row\">\r\n          What is happening now is similar to the hatred Muslims faced after the\r\n          Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. On that tragic day, innocent Muslims\r\n          around the world were turned from practicing Islam peacefully to\r\n          practicing with fear. That was before I was born, but I still vividly\r\n          remember the day I learned about the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks from a\r\n          newspaper. I remember asking my siblings what they did when this\r\n          situation was happening and one of them said, “Because of 9/11, we\r\n          weren’t able to come to the United States early in our life.” 9/11 was\r\n          transformative for all Muslims and not in a positive way. Many Muslims\r\n          were not only afraid to be their true selves outside of their comfort\r\n          zone but were ashamed to call themselves Muslim. 9/11 is an example of\r\n          Islamist extremism. Terrorists, rioters, and beggars are just a few\r\n          words that have been used to describe Muslims. Associating incidents\r\n          or diseases with countries, regions, or religions with a certain\r\n          ethnic group creates a stigma against certain races that are already\r\n          marginalized.\r\n        </div>\r\n        <div class=\"row\">\r\n          Sen. Stephanie Chang, D-Detroit, said, “The virus is a virus. It does\r\n          not have a race or ethnicity. We cannot let fear during this uncertain\r\n          time turn people toward prejudice and hate.” Now is the time for Asian\r\n          Americans to speak up and educate others. A crisis does not last\r\n          forever, but its impact is everlasting. Crises provide people with the\r\n          opportunity to speak out and become stronger as a community. Any sort\r\n          of racism that subjects certain groups can be solved by educating the\r\n          general public on how to be careful with the words they use. Simply\r\n          telling people that their ideologies are racist is not going to change\r\n          any of their perspectives. However, educating them on the ideologies\r\n          they hold and the effect it can have on another person is crucial to\r\n          creating a more united country.\r\n        </div>\r\n        <div class=\"row\">\r\n          Rising Voices of Asian American Families is doing just that. Formed as\r\n          a nonprofit to promote civic engagement at the electoral and policy\r\n          level, this organization started a #NoAAPIHate campaign to provide\r\n          Asian Americans with a platform that allows them to speak out during\r\n          this pandemic.\r\n        </div>\r\n        <div class=\"row\">\r\n          COVID-19 is a disease, but Asian Americans are not.
