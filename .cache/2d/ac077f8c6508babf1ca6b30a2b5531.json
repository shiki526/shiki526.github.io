Hunter Blu</h3> </div> <div class=\"textBlock page-section\"> <div class=\"row\"> <p> To cling to life while your motor functions continue to lift your tremendous weight upright.<br><br> How long will I last, standing, waiting.<br><br> The seconds pass, as I slowly lose grip of my balance,<br><br> My existential layers delicately float away in a thin silence, one after the other,<br><br> Falling to my knees, I can feel my body slowly losing its composure to contain my self<br><br> Seconds pass as minutes,<br><br> my spatial awareness suddenly mutes itself out as the world around me evaporates into an abyss of nearly familiar linguistic information<br><br> I am alone<br><br> I am barely holding my self together<br><br> I am waiting on my knees,<br><br> Afraid to fall as I know I will never get up<br><br> Waiting to fall as I try to understand how to say au revoir to the earth beneath me<br><br> My brain could fall out of my body, I could almost imagine what it would be to feel scared<br><br> Slowly, patiently, with a million miles between me and the floor, my body suspends itself in the gravity between me and the ground<br><br> I am falling into my position of death where my body will forever remain encrusted in its lifeless form<br><br> I am thinking of my mother<br><br> Now my father,<br><br> Now a lover,<br><br> And then a friend<br><br> A place, and then a time, and then again and again<br><br> The only thing I surely know is real is the physics that continue to slowly push my body into the floor<br><br> And I am getting closer<br><br> The suspension grows weaker<br><br> Until it snaps, and I am lying on the ground<br><br> Embraced by a chilling wave of warmth I feel an immense wave consume me and surrender what I knew as my body<br><br> into the ether of a moment just before I cried out for a breath of air<br><br> You navigated it<br><br> The calm melancholia that was waiting on your shoulders<br><br> It found you, sitting at the edge of your bed asking yourself, “where do we go from here?”<br><br> As I witness the body separate itself from itself, I am at peace<br><br> And this brings me to tears<br><br> I remembered agony as I passed down Dekalb Avenue with a wind coursing through my hair<br><br> To remember Agony as if you were referring to them as a person<br><br> With a character, body and personality<br><br> To remember its face without the finer details but what they made you feel<br><br> I didn’t know you before, but now, I pass you in the hallway as if you were a stranger<br><br> I didn’t know If I was going to look back to try and catch your eye because I wasn’t sure what I would do if I did<br><br> It's on this street that I heard you on the phone<br><br> My silence filled the air with the sound of psychic contortion<br><br> A sound which now lays ingrained in my synapses<br><br> I heard you in my home, and I was quiet then too<br><br> Your voice struck me and I shed tears at your projections<br><br> And now I am forgetting where I am<br><br> Finding myself locked in memories my youth doesn’t recognize<br><br> Fighting with the repercussions of feeling “free<br><br>” I claim this land but I do not own it, it owns me<br><br> To be left with the uncertainty of whether or not to choose to believe in fate<br><br> Or to let fate choose to believe in you<br><br> Suddenly a question condenses on the glass between my mind and the world outer<br><br> Reaching to know something real<br><br> “Who?”<br><br> Who reemerging into an atmosphere of abjection, I find my sense of self materializing into a seat in a dimly lit room<br><br> The ceiling fan above me creaks at every other rotation and I am hardly aware of how I got there<br><br> The floor shakes and I recognize the rumble of the subway beneath my breath<br><br> Each breath becoming more stabilized than all the rest<br><br> It&#39;s 10:44 and soon I will lay my head to sleep<br><br> </p> </div> <div class=\"row\"> <h3>How does your work connect to the BLM movement or systemic racism?</h3> <p class=\"italic\"> The strings which attach my work to the systematic racism that politicizes my body are tethered. In my poetry, I often find myself \"freestyling\" through my hands onto the keyboard or into the pen. Where the reality of alienation and gravity of oppression sinks itself into my words. It's one of the only mediums in which I can have a dialogue with my blood and my history primordially. Within the last three years, my family and I have lost six of our loved ones, nearly all were tragic. Most recently COVID-19 took the lives of my Grandpa and Uncle Jose. At 20 years old, meditating with mourning and melancholia has never felt more valuable. From an even larger picture, between viruses and bureaucratic brutality, it feels as if grief is an inescapable truth of black consciousness. A truth which has touched my life deeply in the these last quick years of youth. Although, within my infatuation with death I find an undaunting certainty at the end of my imagination. My writing allows me to weave and work through these issues as new traumas present themselves to me through technology, grief, and time. </p> </div> </div> </div> <section id=\"footer\"></section> <script src=\"/42f69825340f0b5fa628d80900a46daa.js\"></script> </body></html>"},"sourceMaps":null,"error":null,"hash":"98cd1951fd4dd736f57ef7321fb36422","cacheData":{"env":{}}}
