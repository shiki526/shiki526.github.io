Could you please tell us about yourself and introduce GenZ Girl\r\n            Gang?\r\n          </h3>\r\n          <p>\r\n            My name is Sequoia Smith, and I&rsquo;m the Directory of Advocacy\r\n            and Communications at GenZ Girl Gang. I graduated from Mount Saint\r\n            Mary&rsquo;s University in Los Angeles, California. I majored in\r\n            Political Science and minored in Pre-law in the hope of going to law\r\n            school and becoming a criminal defense attorney. <br>\r\n            GenZ Girl Gang is a bold experiment in the way we use social media\r\n            as a community-building tool. We challenge the basic features of\r\n            Instagram to build deeper connections and provide resources to our\r\n            community members on how they can support each other and redefine\r\n            sisterhood in the age of social media and infinite connection.\r\n          </p>\r\n        </div>\r\n\r\n        <div class=\"row\">\r\n          <h3>\r\n            2.

What does the &ldquo;bold&rdquo; mean to you?\r\n            What does &ldquo;sisterhood&rdquo; mean to you?\r\n          </h3>\r\n          <p>\r\n            To us bold means not being afraid of stepping out of the boundaries\r\n            that society places us in. GenZ Girl Gang uses a whole new framework\r\n            of how we connect to our audience and build community with them.<br>\r\n            Sisterhood to us means community. Your community are the people who\r\n            show up for you no matter what, cheer you on and support you in your\r\n            endeavors but at the same time hold you accountable when you mess\r\n            up.\r\n          </p>\r\n        </div>\r\n\r\n        <div class=\"row\">\r\n          <h3>\r\n            3.

If we do not\r\n            take swift action to slow climate change down, it will not matter if\r\n            we have affordable housing or end gun violence since there will be\r\n            no planet to live on.\r\n          </p>\r\n        </div>\r\n\r\n        <div class=\"row\">\r\n          <h3>\r\n            4.

We think\r\n            it&rsquo;s important to root sisterhood in community because\r\n            community is the lifeline for every strong woman and femme.\r\n          </p>\r\n        </div>\r\n\r\n        <div class=\"row\">\r\n          <h3>\r\n            5.

We strongly believe that it is important for women\r\n            and femmes to work together instead of working against each other.\r\n            When women treat each other as collaborators instead of competition\r\n            innovation is allowed to take hold.\r\n          </p>\r\n        </div>\r\n\r\n        <div class=\"row\">\r\n          <h3>\r\n            6.

The Demand and Disruptcampaign taught\r\n            community members skills to advocate for their needs and disrupt\r\n            traditional views of professionalism in the workplace, resulting in\r\n            this Teen Vogue feature. GenZ Girl Gang&rsquo;s College Access for\r\n            All campaign used Instagram&rsquo;s chat feature to connect ninety\r\n            high school juniors and seniors to mentorship from current college\r\n            students and brought to life an in-person event n inclusivity in\r\n            higher education in partnership with Samsung 837. Most recently,\r\n            GenZ Girl Gang has been exploring how to celebrate platonic love,\r\n            hype up ourselves and our friends, and build power in our personal\r\n            networks through the Pitch, Please campaign.\r\n          </p>\r\n        </div>\r\n\r\n        <div class=\"row\">\r\n          <h3>\r\n            7.

So often, women and femmes are taught\r\n            there can only be one seat at the table that we must compete with\r\n            each other for, but our generation won't settle for a seat at the\r\n            table. We are creating our own. We&rsquo;re taking steps today to\r\n            build a future where congresswomen, astronauts, entrepreneurs, those\r\n            who will hold jobs that we cannot even imagine yet are connected in\r\n            interdisciplinary personal networks.
