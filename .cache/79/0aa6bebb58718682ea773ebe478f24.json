In a time of racial movements across the United States, her presence as the first Black and Indo-American woman on a major party ticket is monumental for BIPOC. Her heritage will allow her to connect with various groups and identities, which will bring more political recognition to the Indian, South Asian, and African American communities and hopefully bring better representation to what being an American is. </p> <b>Role in the 2020 Election</b> <p style=\"text-indent:50px;\"> As Joe Biden’s running mate, Harris plays an integral role in shaping the election. She will allow the Democratic Party to connect with a wider audience, as well as help win battleground states, states that swing between Democratic and Republican Parties. Recent national polls have put Biden ahead of Trump in three states: Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, and Michigan. These states are significant because in the previous election President Trump secured his seat in the oval office by defeating Clinton with fewer than 80,000 votes in these three states, granting him a total of 46 electoral votes that secured his presidency. Harris may be the ultimate strategy to help Biden win the 2020 election. </p> <p style=\"text-indent:50px;\"> The demographics for Indian-Americans have reached significant growth, which can swing the outcome of the upcoming election. AAPI Data has revealed that Asian-Americans and Pacific Islander populations have almost doubled in the last decade in six states (Florida, Michigan, North Carolina, Georgia, and Texas). With the rise in AAPI, Harris’s name is promising in representing Indian-Americans and other immigrant groups, which can lead to increased voter turnout. Having the support of Indian-Americans to increase BIPOC voting is essential to securing victory in the upcoming election. Indian Americans have historically been strong voters for the Democratic Party (77 percent of Indian Americans voted for Clinton in 2016), and if Harris’ presence can increase voter turnout in this population, the Democratic Party may be able to win it. Harris has not only brought positive change to Biden’s campaign, but she has also contributed to the rise in Indian-American elected congressmen such as Pramila Jayapal, Ro Khanna, and Raja Krishnamoorthi: a pivotal step for the inclusion of representing Indian-American communities. </p> <b>The Odds of Winning</b> <p style=\"text-indent:50px;\"> Selecting Kamala Harris as Biden’s running mate was a strategic decision. On the day Harris was formally announced as Biden’s Vice President running mate, prediction markets about the US election showed that Biden’s chances increased by two percentage points while Trump dropped by two. So far, Biden has continued to be favored in the polls with a 49-40 over Trump. In battleground states, the Democratic Party is ahead with 49.7 to 45.7 in Florida, 48.0 to 41.7 in Michigan, and leads the polls in Wisconsin, Arizona, North Carolina, Ohio, and Pennsylvania. Trump won every one of these states in the 2016 election; three states in particular -- Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin -- led him to his ultimate victory, winning by less than 1 percent of the vote in the previous election. With Biden leading the way in these states and Harris as his running mate, many are hopeful that he will be elected into the office in the winter. </p> <p style=\"text-indent:50px;\"> Having Kamala Harris as the vice presidential candidate for Joe Biden is a promising hope for underrepresented and politically marginalized communities in America. In all considerations, Kamala Harris has the credentials and expertise to be the next vice president, as she is currently the U.S Senator for California and has served as California’s Attorney General. However, I believe Biden’s choice of vice president was an act of tokenism. Tokenism is the act of including members from minority groups to seem more inclusive and accepting to the general public. In this case, it was done by choosing Harris for the reason that she is a part of Black and Indian communities to give the overview of diversity. Before Harris was officially picked, Biden announced that he planned to choose a Black woman to be his running mate; while Harris was on his list, a majority of the contenders were Black women, shedding a light on tokenism, the idea that her heritage was the reason why she was even considered apart from other equally qualified politicians. Even so, Harris is the right person the country needs in a time where racism is a significant issue in society. </p> <p style=\"text-indent:50px;\"> In my opinion, Harris will provide the pathway for better representation for not just Indian and Black communities, but also prominent issues including marriage inequality. For over almost two decades, Kamala Harris has been a strong supporter of marriage equality. On Valentines Day sixteen years ago, same sex marriage was legal in San Fransico. Harris played a monumental role since then and officiated the first same sex wedding ceremonies that day. But when those same marriages were later invalidated and not recognized under the law, Harris did not lose hope and continued to fight for same sex marriage for over a decade. In 2008, same sex marriage was legalised in California, but again failed because Proposition 8 was rebanned, which no longer allowed same sex weddings. Still, these obstacles were unable to hold Harris back. In 2010, Kamala Harris took Proposition 8 as part of her campaign platform to become the Attorney General of California. Her victory as Attorney General allowed her to carry through with her pledge to block the state’s defense of Proposition 8 until a Third Party appeal was brought. The case made its way to the Supreme Court; Harris followed every footstep and attended every court hearing. Finally, the Supreme Court ordered same sex marriages in California to be legalised, and Proposition 8 to be unconstituional in 2010. Harris’ perservance in advocating for same sex marriage shows her dedication in fighting for issues that matter to us, and there is no doubt she will continue to do so if elected Vice President. Her setbacks never discouraged her, which is what a leader represents. </p> </div> <div class=\"row\"> <h3 style=\"text-align:center;\">Works Cited</h3> <div style=\"text-indent:-36px;padding-left:36px;\"> <p> Biswas, Soutik. “Biden's VP Pick: Why Kamala Harris Embraces Her Biracial Roots.” <i>BBC News</i>, BBC, 11 Aug. 2020, www.bbc.com/news/election-us-2020-53745141. </p> <br> <p> Kalita, S.
