Conservative Think?: The Reactionary Mind of a ‘Child of God’ <div class=\"author\">By: Theo Brandt</div> </div> <div class=\"textBlock page-section\"> <div class=\"row\"> <i>Interview with Christian Medina</i> </div> <blockquote> <p style=\"text-indent:50px;\">\"To obey a real superior … is one of the most important of all virtues--a virtue absolutely essential to the attainment of anything great and lasting.\"</p> <br> <footer>—James Fitzjames Stephen, conservative English lawyer</footer> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p style=\"text-indent:50px;\">\"When the multitude are not under this discipline [of] … the wiser, the more expert, and the more opulent, … they can scarcely be said to be in civil society.”</p> <br> <footer>—Edmund Burke, counterrevolutionary English lawyer/political philosopher</footer> </blockquote> <div class=\"row\"> <p style=\"text-indent:50px;\">In <i>The Reactionary Mind: Conservatism from Edmund Burke to Sarah Palin</i>, political scientist Corey Robin argues that conservatives are reactionary in theory but radical in practice. Conservatives aim to retain traditionalism and to not change society, but because society is against conservative principles they must act like radicals and perform as minorities. That’s why <u><a style=\"color:#00f\" href=\"https://prospect.org/power/americans-liberal-even-know/\">the majority of Americans support liberal policies</a></u> but <u><a style=\"color:#00f\" href=\"https://news.gallup.com/poll/275792/remained-center-right-ideologically-2019.aspx\">a plurality identify as conservative.</a></u> More dangerous than this political ideology gaslighting is the conservative (and anti-democratic) belief that virtuous people should be at the top of any societal hierarchy, and reactionaries generally take comfort in “hard-working” and “intelligent” people maintaining order over the degraded masses (see quotes above). Oddly, someone who really epitomizes these characteristics briefly joined Detester as a staff writer. So I interviewed him to see how Robin’s framework plays out on the level of an individual conservative.</p> <h3>From your poetry, you seem to be more socially conservative than economically conservative? What are your economic beliefs? What do you think about ‘capitalism’?</h3> <p style=\"text-indent:50px;\">“I support capitalism and the right to a private business not owned by the state or government. I think socialism is a stupid and failing idea. Venezuela tried and failed. Cuba is failing. Socialism never works, and in a country with a population of 326 million, it’ll fail from the start. Not sure if the first part is a question or statement, although I’d say I’m more economically conservative.”</p> <h3>Can you define “Child of God”? What do you mean by this?</h3> <p style=\"text-indent:50px;\">“Someone who truly follows Yeshua. Someone who breaks free from sin, and the temptations of this world. Someone who represents and is used for good in the eyes of the Lord. Someone who uses his gifts and abilities to glorify God.”</p> <h3>You mention “virtuous people” in your poetry. What makes someone virtuous? Why is it important to be virtuous?</h3> <p style=\"text-indent:50px;\">“Connection to God, or rather, and in most cases, a strong connection to your spirit. Seperation [sic] from the desensitization and corruption of this world.”</p> <h3>What are your parents’ political beliefs?</h3> <p style=\"text-indent:50px;\">“Democratic all the way.”</p> <h3>What do you think about Trump’s response to COVID-19? Do you think people should wear masks?</h3> <p style=\"text-indent:50px;\">“Trump had asked for advice from Fauci months before the virus really started to spread. Fauci told him it was nothing to worry about. Trump listened. Now, Fauci made a mistake, and Trump is being blamed for the lives of thousands. I think people who don’t have a connection with God should wear a mask. So I completely agree with wearing a mask, and I’d wear a mask too. Although note that I’d only wear it because it’s required in most places.”</p> <h3>What do you think of leftists and progressives?</h3> <p style=\"text-indent:50px;\">“I see nothing wrong with progressives in theory and that’s relatively the same in practice. It would depend on what the common people were like and what their interests were.There are a lot of good leftists that just want certain change, and can be civil which is what I respect. I don’t agree on a lot of things leftists want, and their actions are sometimes a bit questionable. A lot of lefties do just assume that I stand with all things evil though [sic].”</p> <h3>You claim that liberals have made a strawman of your beliefs, meaning that when they hear that you are a conservative, they automatically believe you are prejudiced. Why do you think they do this? How is their strawman different from your views?</h3> <p style=\"text-indent:50px;\">“It’s easier to win an argument if you present the other not with facts, but the assumptions you want in order to win. Plus, it’s their way of appearing morally righteous as well. Makes them feel like they’re actually doing something to change or help. It’s different because they seem to think that everything I stand for is meant strictly for destruction and chaos to instill in our country. I want the opposite. I want to make abortion illegal for doctors because I think it’s immoral, not because I don’t want women to have a choice. I want prosperity and peace to come, but that doesn’t happen by making life appear to be more free. Life still needs discipline and some structural order to keep society stable.”</p> <h3>What was one time a liberal has been “aggressive” toward you?</h3> <p style=\"text-indent:50px;\">“I don’t think any liberals have assaulted me. My family calls me a racist and, a white supremacist. A lot of the times, they’ll threaten harm but won’t act on it.”</p> </div> </div> </div>  <section id=\"footer\"></section> <script src=\"/42f69825340f0b5fa628d80900a46daa.js\"></script> </body></html>"},"sourceMaps":null,"error":null,"hash":"9dacc7bbb475d75c954eb7074b60c93c","cacheData":{"env":{}}}
