Thousands of\r\n                protesters marched in the streets of Minneapolis, the city where Floyd lived and was murdered by police. These protests\r\n                quickly spread through the rest of the nation and across the globe as a collective act of solidarity for George Floyd\r\n                and countless other victims of police brutality. These protests later became associated with the larger Black Lives\r\n                Matter movement that started in 2013.</p>\r\n                <p>As a result of police brutality being brought to the forefront of national attention, there was a distinct shift in the\r\n                type of content being circulated around social media platforms. Posts providing links to petitions and charities were\r\n                shared in mass quantities, replacing the usual images of dogs and poorly lit selfies. During this period, people were\r\n                more vocal than ever about social justice issues; it was the peak of digital activism.</p>\r\n                <p>Suddenly, on June 2, 2020, a flood of black squares accompanied by the caption #blackouttuesday took social media by\r\n                storm.</p>\r\n                <p>Blackout Tuesday, an organized event that sparked an abrupt change in our feeds, stemmed from #TheShowMustBeStopped, an\r\n                initiative created by music executives Brianna Agyemang and Jamila Thomas, who recognized that Black artists have been\r\n                historically disadvantaged because of their race– from producers discrediting their work to refusing to acknowledge the\r\n                impact that Black culture has had on the music and entertainment industry. #TheShowMustBeStopped strived to encourage\r\n                its participants to refrain from releasing new music and cease business.</p>\r\n                <p>Spotify and Apple Music, for example, curated playlists entirely composed of songs written by Black artists and added an\r\n                8:46-minute moment of silence on certain playlists, the amount of time that Derek Chauvin had kneeled on George Floyd’s\r\n                neck. Other music companies, such as Universal Music Group and Sony, pledged $25 million and $100 million, respectively,\r\n                to support anti-racist efforts in the music industry and general population.</p>\r\n                <p>As the movement became more mainstream amongst the youth, many were encouraged to use Blackout Tuesday as an opportunity\r\n                to reflect on the recent events and America’s history with the Black Lives Matter movement. Participants were encouraged\r\n                to silence their voices to show their solidarity with the Black Lives Matter movement by posting black squares on their\r\n                feeds with the caption #blackouttuesday. While the cause may have been well-intended, the execution of Blackout Tuesday\r\n                inadvertently stunted the progress of the movement. The silence was meant to disrupt feeds, yet it ended up muting the\r\n                movement completely by drowning out important resources through the misuse of the #BlackLivesMatter hashtag and\r\n                overwhelming our screens with nothing but black tiles.</p>\r\n                <p>Blackout Tuesday was a collective act of performative activism. Individuals demonstrated a sense of concern towards\r\n                prominent issues for the sake of their media presence, as opposed to bringing attention to the cause itself. This, while\r\n                arguably being more effective than doing nothing at all, does not beneficially contribute to the movement if you\r\n                ultimately do not care. When you share an infographic that has been spreading within your group of followers without\r\n                reading it just to promote your own agenda of being anti-racist and socially well-informed, consider the lengths that\r\n                you’re willing to go to take advantage of the issues in our society to demonstrate how compassionate and educated you\r\n                are.</p>\r\n                <p>Black Lives Matter is not a trend that you can use to your advantage to build up your social capital. An infographic on\r\n                your Instagram story should not be used as a shield to prevent backlash when you decide that a picture of your breakfast\r\n                was more worthy to share than an infographic with information on bail funds and hotlines. Even if you had good\r\n                intentions, your “allyship” is meaningless if the impact you caused is anything but actively supporting and advocating\r\n                for the issue at hand.</p>\r\n                <p>Similarly to when Instagram users changed their profile pictures to blue for #BlueforSudan, which was started in\r\n                solidarity with protests in the wake of the death of Mohamed Hashim Mattar, or when Facebook users used a filter of a\r\n                French flag over their profile pictures for #PrayforParis in an attempt to sympathize with those affected by the\r\n                terrorist attacks in Paris, the extent to which people cared about Black Lives Matter was demonstrated through their\r\n                token black square and absence of financial, social, and political support.</p>\r\n                <p>This is the boundary that separates performative and authentic allyship.</p>\r\n                <p>Behind each repost on your Instagram story is a real issue where people are suffering, being oppressed, or fighting for\r\n                their lives. They deserve more than the two minutes it takes for you to repost the story. They deserve more than just 24\r\n                hours of attention.</p>\r\n                <p>Nevertheless, while having a platform allows you to spread awareness on important issues, you are still entitled to what\r\n                you post on your own account. Regardless, it is also your responsibility to consider the moral obligation that comes\r\n                from this privilege and the effects that result from it.</p>\r\n                <p>While utilizing social media platforms is known to be an effective and popular way to participate in activism, it is not\r\n                necessarily essential to address important issues. Your actions matter as much offline as they do online, if not more.\r\n                Signing petitions, protesting, and educating yourself is just as important as sharing a post on Instagram.</p>\r\n                <p>With the elections coming up in a few months, one of the most important things you can do as an ally for racial equality\r\n                is to vote– specifically for a candidate that shares the same anti-racist goals as you. After all, posting a black\r\n                square is inconsequential to voting for an official that can enact federal change to the most significant contributor to\r\n                racism– institutions. It is counterproductive to vote for someone who is against the policies that you advocate for.</p>\r\n                <p>Continue being active in the fights against social injustices. Even if you are only able to sign petitions, continue to\r\n                do so– even if you think they won’t make an impact, because they do. Elijah McCain’s case was reopened after his\r\n                petition gained over 2 million signatures. Trayvon Martin’s murderer was charged with second-degree murder after his\r\n                petition gained over 2.2 million signatures. Donate to bail funds for protestors or call your local representatives if\r\n                you can. Continue the fight for those who have not earned justice yet.</p>\r\n                <p>Make the effort to prove your allyship beyond your hyperactive Instagram page. But to do so, ask yourself this first:</p>\r\n                <p class=\"italic\">\r\n                    When will you stop hiding behind the shield of your black square and start actively fighting against the issues at hand?\r\n                </p>\r\n            </div>\r\n        </div>\r\n    </div>\r\n    \r\n\r\n    <section id=\"footer\"></section>\r\n    <script src=\"/42f69825340f0b5fa628d80900a46daa.js\"></script>\r\n</body>\r\n\r\n</html>"},"sourceMaps":null,"error":null,"hash":"7a3c5f0ceeb38a29b2c4d8eba59fe736","cacheData":{"env":{}}}
