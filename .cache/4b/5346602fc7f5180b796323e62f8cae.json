Introduce yourself!\r\n        </h4>\r\n      </div>\r\n      <p>\r\n        ’m a Trinbagonian Artist, Illustrator and Graphic Designer in training currently studying in the United States.\r\n        At a tender age I luckily discovered my inherited artistic abilities when I was bored one Christmas day and\r\n        decided to draw ’The Grinch’, ever since then my passion for the Arts has only grown and never wavered. Fun fact\r\n        due to my consistent activity within the artistic community I became the German ‘Buddy Bear’ Artist for my home\r\n        country.\r\n      </p>\r\n\r\n      <div class=\"row\">\r\n        <h4 class=\"mohogany\">\r\n          2. How have you identified yourself as a BIPOC individual through your creative work?\r\n        </h4>\r\n      </div>\r\n      <p>\r\n        Being from a heavily diverse Caribbean island with a host of multi-cultural people and environments I’ve always\r\n        made it my mission to incorporate my Caribbean influences into my artwork in anyway possible. As my love for\r\n        portraitures runs deep these influences usually take the form of a diversified feed of main figures/people along\r\n        with bright colors or symbols that are normally associated with BIPOC. Overall, through doing this I’ve been\r\n        able to effectively showcase my cultural background and influences in an appealing way that engages others’\r\n        interest.\r\n      </p>\r\n\r\n      <div class=\"row\">\r\n        <h4 class=\"mohogany\">\r\n          3. How has your creative work allowed you to express yourself?\r\n        </h4>\r\n      </div>\r\n      <p>\r\n        II’m an omnivert but I side heavily with my introverted self. However, despite being able to vocally express my\r\n        opinions on a issue that I feel strongly about I’d rather showcase my point of view through using my own art.\r\n        Therefore, I essentially use my artistic works as my voice to express myself better to others in a more creative\r\n        way.\r\n      </p>\r\n\r\n      <div class=\"row\">\r\n        <h4 class=\"mohogany\">\r\n          4. What is your stance on BIPOC representation in the media?\r\n        </h4>\r\n      </div>\r\n      <p>\r\n        Presently I would say that there is very little BIPOC representation within the media and the ones that exist\r\n        tend to come across very stereotypically. That being the case, I advocate that more realistic representation is\r\n        desperately needed as through improving this aspect within the media can lead to a better and brighter future of\r\n        equality and diversity.\r\n      </p>\r\n\r\n      <div class=\"row\">\r\n        <h4 class=\"mohogany\">\r\n          5. How has your culture influenced your work and who you are today?\r\n        </h4>\r\n      </div>\r\n      <p>\r\n        Growing up on an island that has been described as a melting pot of races has definitely served me well as an\r\n        artist. Through my experiences learned through my interactions with other cultures and races I’ve been able to\r\n        gain a unique perspective not normally obtained by many and that has allowed me to produce artwork that not only\r\n        appeals to the masses but also highlights some aspect of my culture that has shaped the person I am today.\r\n        Likewise, as I’m now studying abroad being from a diverse country affords me an artistic outlook and\r\n        characteristics as an artist international.\r\n      </p>\r\n\r\n      <div class=\"row\">\r\n        <h4 class=\"mohogany\">\r\n          6.
