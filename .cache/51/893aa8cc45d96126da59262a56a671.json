In context, these checks may happen at the\r\n            request of anyone who is worried that an elder might have passed\r\n            away in their home, an acquaintance is having or acting on suicidal\r\n            thoughts, or a lover of a long-distance relationship is in critical\r\n            danger. It is worth noting, however, that mental health crises have\r\n            become the leading reason for conducting welfare checks in recent\r\n            years, with approximately 10,000 related calls every month and\r\n            “growing exponentially”, according to an RCMP commissioner.\r\n          </p>\r\n          <p>\r\n            The requests for these checks are usually made by friends, family,\r\n            or neighbours. However, it is generally acceptable for anyone to\r\n            make the call – which can be problematic as there are no preventive\r\n            measures for potential fraud calls.\r\n          </p>\r\n          <p>\r\n            There are two ways to get in touch with the law enforcement\r\n            authorities where the welfare check will be conducted: the emergency\r\n            number, 911, and a non-emergency crisis line that varies depending\r\n            on one’s local police department. Once one is in contact with the\r\n            authorities, they have the right to accompany the police officers\r\n            who are going. However, this would not be possible in situations\r\n            where one does not live within a relative distance to their subjects\r\n            of concern.\r\n          </p>\r\n          <p>\r\n            Once the police officers arrive at the scene, how they choose to act\r\n            is surprisingly variable. “...[T]here’s no standard for wellness\r\n            check protocols across Canada – those are determined by individual\r\n            police services,” explained Jennifer Lavoie, professor of\r\n            criminology at Wilfrid Laurier University.\r\n          </p>\r\n          <p>\r\n            Regardless of the lack of a universal guideline, it is a common\r\n            practice for officers to knock on the door and identify themselves\r\n            as law enforcement officials upon arrival. After a reasonable time\r\n            of awaiting response, the police may forcefully enter a private\r\n            premise if they hold reasonable belief that their entry is necessary\r\n            to ensure safety. In some cases, this legal permission for\r\n            warrantless entries can be lifesaving; emergency medical or force\r\n            intervention can be offered when the one inside the residence is\r\n            unable to respond. However, in many other cases, complaints have\r\n            been filed regarding the privacy invasion by police officers who\r\n            utilized this permission of forceful entry without informing the\r\n            residents of their identities.\r\n          </p>\r\n          <p>\r\n            After the interaction, the wellness checks supposedly end in one of\r\n            three ways. If the police had ensured the person in question to be\r\n            in good health and safety, they would notify the caller and dismiss\r\n            their concerns. However, if the authorities had discovered the\r\n            person to be physically or mentally compromised, they should\r\n            immediately call medical assistance and inform the caller of the\r\n            situation. They will stay at the location until – if possible – the\r\n            caller comes. Lastly, if a check results with the person deceased,\r\n            medical attention should be given and an investigation will be\r\n            conducted. The deceased may have passed away due to natural or\r\n            self-inflicted causes before the officers' arrival, but it is also\r\n            common – as we have discovered – that police misconduct plays a role\r\n            in the death.\r\n          </p>\r\n          <p>\r\n            It seems that the wellness checks are, overall, initiated with good\r\n            intentions. However, why do we see such shocking numbers of injuries\r\n            and casualties from these potentially lifesaving visits?\r\n          </p>\r\n          <p>\r\n            To gain more insights into the influencing factors, I’ve fortunately\r\n            been able to speak with an insider of this growing issue.\r\n          </p>\r\n        </div>\r\n        <div class=\"row\">\r\n          <h3>A Survivor’s Tale</h3>\r\n          <p>\r\n            Despite the controversy surrounding police wellness checks stirring\r\n            up around May with the first widely reported casualties, I\r\n            regrettably had not seen it as a personal matter until late June,\r\n            when the civil suit featuring Mona Wang against the RCMP was brought\r\n            to my attention.\r\n          </p>\r\n          <p>\r\n            The incident had happened in January of this year, when the nursing\r\n            student at the University of British Columbia Okanagan Campus was\r\n            severely assaulted during a wellness check. She was kicked, stepped\r\n            on, sworn at, handcuffed, and dragged through the floors of her\r\n            apartment building half-dressed and on her stomach, which caused\r\n            notable injuries on her face and body. It is incomprehensible how\r\n            such derogatory actions were deemed necessary, as the officer had\r\n            found her semi-unconscious and evidently more of a harm to herself\r\n            than others.\r\n          </p>\r\n          <p>\r\n            Mona’s story, accompanied by horribly disturbing video footage, had\r\n            filled me with shock, rage, and panic for the proximity of this\r\n            crisis to myself - as we are both Chinese-Canadian students native\r\n            to the westernmost province of Canada. I contacted her through\r\n            social media and acquired her opinions on various aspects of this\r\n            issue, which – with her permission – will be shared below.\r\n          </p>\r\n        </div>\r\n        <div class=\"row\">\r\n          <h3>The Interview</h3>\r\n        </div>\r\n        <div class=\"row\">\r\n          <h4 class=\"italic\">\r\n            <span class=\"italic underline\">Question 1:</span> “Do you think the\r\n            police are reliable people to call in the event of mental distress\r\n            or mental health crisis?”\r\n          </h4>\r\n          <p class=\"italic rightAligned\">\r\n            “I definitely do not believe that the police are reliable,\r\n            especially not by themselves…because they (the police) deal with a\r\n            lot of sensitive issues, and typically violence, I think that they\r\n            kind of resort to violence really quickly as well, which is\r\n            something that I think healthcare workers don't usually do.”\r\n          </p>\r\n          <p class=\"italic rightAligned\">\r\n            “I feel like they just skip the words and go straight to violence a\r\n            lot of the time.”\r\n          </p>\r\n          <p>\r\n            It surprises me that Mona can show such compassion by trying to\r\n            understand the reason behind the officers’ adverse reactions even\r\n            after her traumatizing experience. Indeed, many mental health\r\n            advocates have also pointed out the issue of the police’s\r\n            instinctual response of violence due to the predominant nature of\r\n            their work.\r\n          </p>\r\n          <p>\r\n            Ingrid Waldron, an associate professor at Dalhousie University's\r\n            School of Nursing, had said during a CBC interview, “That's a very\r\n            specialized skill ... dealing with individuals who have mental\r\n            health issues and being able to interact with them in a\r\n            non-aggressive way.” And it is evident that the police do not have\r\n            enough training in this “very specialized skill”.\r\n          </p>\r\n          <p class=\"italic rightAligned\">\r\n            “I just don't believe that they have the necessary training in six\r\n            months…I don't think that's enough at all to be handling these\r\n            issues. And, as healthcare workers, like as a registered nurse\r\n            (myself), that's four years of training on healthcare, medical\r\n            topics, and de-escalation. That's substantially more training than\r\n            the police have.”\r\n          </p>\r\n          <p class=\"italic rightAligned\">\r\n            “If the police aren’t reliable, what can they do to rebuild the\r\n            trust with the public?”\r\n          </p>\r\n          <p class=\"italic rightAligned\">\r\n            “(to rebuild the trust) I think that the best thing that they could\r\n            do (regarding this situation) is to partner up with a health\r\n            authority and have a certain program, or certain responders, who\r\n            would go alongside the police, or have the police not go at all.”\r\n          </p>\r\n          <p>\r\n            The approach of having a mental health crisis response program has\r\n            actually been implemented in Canada since 2014. Most municipal\r\n            police departments of medium- to large-sized populations have some\r\n            form of an integrated mental health team, which partners police with\r\n            mental health professionals to perform these wellness checks. In\r\n            fact, the use of these teams in cities such as Hamilton, Ontario,\r\n            has led to a significant decrease in the number of people detained\r\n            for mental health reasons.\r\n          </p>\r\n          <p>\r\n            However, as the recent spike in casualties suggests, there are still\r\n            faults within the system. Some of the problems include these\r\n            specialized units not responding around the clock – which affects\r\n            the individuals experiencing mental distress during the very late or\r\n            early hours of the day – the professionals being brought into the\r\n            situations too late, and the intimidating authority the police have\r\n            over these professionals.\r\n          </p>\r\n          <p>\r\n            Sarah Reynolds, a Toronto psychiatric nurse who had worked with the\r\n            police for 18 months, has commented \"If there was ever any talk of a\r\n            weapon or ‘an unstable situation’ during a wellness check, police\r\n            would quickly take over.”, and that “The nurses could be far more\r\n            effective if we were front and centre doing the major assessment,\r\n            and having police as back up.”\r\n          </p>\r\n          <p>\r\n            Regarding the bolder approach of removing the police completely from\r\n            psychiatric emergencies, there has been a precedent case in\r\n            Stockholm, the capital city of Sweden, in which a mental health\r\n            ambulance with solely psychiatric nurses and paramedics was\r\n            implemented in 2015. According to data presented in the\r\n            International Journal of Mental Health, this unique program served\r\n            well during its first year of operations, with high-quality\r\n            pre-hospital care being provided immediately to those in crisis and\r\n            significant reduction of police interference and workload.

I think even a regular person seeing that kind of\r\n            thing would immediately think of calling an ambulance or calling for\r\n            some form of backup, which she had not done at all at any step\r\n            during her visit to me, she had not called the EMT and like…that's\r\n            just baffling.”\r\n          </p>\r\n          <p>\r\n            It is truly astonishing that medical assistance was never offered;\r\n            instead, it was replaced by verbal and physical abuse that did more\r\n            damage to Mona’s physical and mental health.

And that all contributes to\r\n            everything that happens.

While…in reality, they’re\r\n            more of a harm to themselves than others.”\r\n          </p>\r\n          <p>\r\n            It is also worth noting that the officer involved in the incident\r\n            had claimed that Mona was high on methamphetamine or some type of\r\n            illicit drug, which, as multiple tests had shown, is not true.\r\n            Regardless of whether the officer had really held this belief or\r\n            simply stated this as an excuse for her outrageous actions, her\r\n            statement implicitly suggested the prominent misrepresentation and\r\n            stigmatization of substance use disorders in our society. Struggling\r\n            with substance abuse should at no point be an excuse for any kind of\r\n            physical or verbal abuse.\r\n          </p>\r\n          <p>\r\n            So, despite there being undoubtedly more advocacy for mental illness\r\n            in recent years, it has proven to be far from enough. When a police\r\n            officer interacts with someone in psychological distress, the\r\n            pre-existing hyperbolic stereotype of criminality can have a\r\n            detrimental effect on his or her actions. The stigma also has an\r\n            extended impact on the receiving ends of the wellness checks. Since\r\n            those being helped acknowledge that the officers hold a\r\n            stereotypical view of them and are likely to use force, their fear\r\n            of that situation pushes them deeper into mental distress, which\r\n            might further evoke panic and alarm from the police. Overall, it can\r\n            be said that “shattering the stigma” and breaking the bond between\r\n            mental illness and criminality will be unmeasurably beneficial for\r\n            everyone involved in this crisis.\r\n          </p>\r\n        </div>\r\n        <div class=\"row\">\r\n          <h4 class=\"italic\">\r\n            <span class=\"italic underline\">Question 4:</span> “What message(s)\r\n            do you hope to spread by speaking out about your experience?”\r\n          </h4>\r\n          <p>\r\n            With thousands – in separate physical rallies and online –\r\n            protesting for a change, I think Mona’s courageous act of speaking\r\n            out has truly had positive influences.
