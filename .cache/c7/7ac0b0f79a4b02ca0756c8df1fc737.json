To sell a product to someone who doesn’t want\r\n            to buy it. That is the simple part. The difficulty arrives when you\r\n            sit to decide on ‘how to’. Most cosmetic brands seem to have cracked\r\n            the code. As harsh as it may sound the brands and their\r\n            advertisements feed on a woman’s insecurities. Right from the days\r\n            when Madison Avenue’s sparkling billboards displayed a pretty\r\n            red-lipped blonde, the perfect epitome of womanhood, little has\r\n            changed over the course of time.\r\n          </p>\r\n        </div>\r\n        <div class=\"row\">\r\n          <p>\r\n            Although sincere attempts are being made by brands such as Dove,\r\n            which took the initiative to include women - the “Real Women” - of\r\n            every kind. Some brands have also tried to expand their palette to\r\n            be more inclusive about skin colour. Rihanna’s Fenty Beauty gave the\r\n            industry a massive blow when it launched 40 different shades of\r\n            foundation. It not only shook the traditional notions of beauty but\r\n            opened up a whole platform for all the consumers who have so far\r\n            felt underserved by the giant cosmetic brands.\r\n          </p>\r\n        </div>\r\n        <div class=\"row\">\r\n          <p>\r\n            Yet, there seems to be a significant absence of those women who till\r\n            today are the subjects of several discussions. The transwomen are\r\n            constantly not included in the narrative when it comes to\r\n            advertising for these beauty brands. But they form a significant\r\n            portion of the consumer group, all the while constantly fighting\r\n            against the concept that only external appearance can define who a\r\n            real woman is. The concept of this real woman has been so concocted\r\n            by beauty brands that several trans women feel a very superimposed\r\n            need to use makeup.\r\n          </p>\r\n        </div>\r\n        <div class=\"row\">\r\n          <p>\r\n            Of course, there are the Pride Month quotas that most brands\r\n            diligently participate in but it is important to ask: is that\r\n            enough?\r\n          </p>\r\n        </div>\r\n        <div class=\"row\">\r\n          <p>\r\n            There are some visibly sincere attempts that showcase the real\r\n            struggles of a trans woman and how gracefully she overcomes all of\r\n            it. One of the most successful stories we have come across recently\r\n            is Vicks’ ad (although not a beauty brand) titled ‘Touch of Care’\r\n            which deals with two significant subjects - adoption and transgender\r\n            rights. The ad perfectly captured the real-life story of Gauri\r\n            Sawant, who became the first transgender person in 2014 to file a\r\n            petition in the Supreme Court for the adoption rights of transgender\r\n            people. Told from the perspective of her adopted daughter, Gayatri,\r\n            the ad has put a benchmark about what representation should look\r\n            like. For, while Vicks got it right, several are still staggering in\r\n            the process of ideal story-telling.\r\n          </p>\r\n        </div>\r\n        <div class=\"row\">\r\n          <h3 class=\"makecenter\">Reliance On Tokenism</h3>\r\n        </div>\r\n        <div class=\"row\">\r\n          <p>\r\n            For decades the trans community remained invisible for brands.\r\n            However, with the recent revelation that the queer community’s total\r\n            buying power can be something as close to $917 million brands are\r\n            trying to put things out there as much as they can. They are\r\n            creating exclusive issues and campaigns that only highlight queer\r\n            people and talk about the community at large during the Pride Month.\r\n            Sadly, that is not quite doing the work. In fact, it is nothing but\r\n            sheer tokenism.\r\n          </p>\r\n        </div>\r\n        <div class=\"row\">\r\n          <p>\r\n            While some beauty brands, such as Ciaté London, MAC and Sleek MakeUP\r\n            have tapped on transgender models for their campaigns, it is\r\n            important to ask how much research and work has been put into\r\n            developing the products that suit the transgender community. “Makeup\r\n            products are not researched or developed keeping transgender people\r\n            in mind. Earlier the problem was that the developer of a woman’s\r\n            cosmetic product was a man and then with the women’s movements, that\r\n            gradually changed. The same thing needs to happen with the\r\n            transgender people as well. You have to include people from the\r\n            community in the research and developing sector.”\r\n          </p>\r\n        </div>\r\n        <div class=\"row\">\r\n          <h3 class=\"makecenter\">Inside The Conference Room</h3>\r\n        </div>\r\n        <div class=\"row\">\r\n          <p>\r\n            While several people will claim that there are many ads today\r\n            representing the community, it cannot be denied that these brands\r\n            have failed to maintain the true aspect of inclusion. Brands have\r\n            managed to sensationalise the subject to a point where they “look\r\n            good” to the generation that cares about everyone’s rights. However,\r\n            when it comes to actually hiring a person from the community, there\r\n            is a large vacuum in the conference room that decides upon the\r\n            narrative of these brands.\r\n          </p>\r\n        </div>\r\n        <div class=\"row\">\r\n          <p>\r\n            There can be two reasons behind it. Firstly, there is a\r\n            stereotypical notion that trans people mostly pick up acting or\r\n            modelling as their go-to profession. This results in the common\r\n            practice of commodifying the trans woman’s body for either tokenism\r\n            or a “checkbox” for brands to put a tick on. Secondly, the\r\n            conference room continues to remain a heavily male-dominated space.\r\n            Doel Rakshit, a copywriter and activist based out of Mumbai, said,\r\n            “Till today creating narrative is a very cis-male thing. A woman,\r\n            even a cis-woman, or any marginalized gender ideating and processing\r\n            narratives for brand stories is not something equally applauded.”\r\n          </p>\r\n        </div>\r\n        <div class=\"row\">\r\n          <p>\r\n            The problem with change is that sometimes it is too unorganised.\r\n            While ads are trying to bring in a new narrative, it is unclear if\r\n            that is simply a trend they are following or if it is actually\r\n            something that will sustain. There is also a lack of data when it\r\n            comes to identifying the community. Kiran Khalap, co-founder of\r\n            Chlorophyll brand consultancy, pointed out, “Advertising in general\r\n            lags behind society when it comes to change. There has to be\r\n            representatives who make the industry conscious about its\r\n            unconscious biases.”\r\n          </p>\r\n        </div>\r\n        <div class=\"row\">\r\n          <p>\r\n            In order to make industries aware of the kind of consumers they are\r\n            dealing with there has to be a regular update of census data. With a\r\n            conscious generation that is constantly inclining towards gender\r\n            fluidity and a whole community of people who are fighting every\r\n            single day for their rights, a properly structured data can\r\n            certainly put an end to the age-old question of, “how many people\r\n            are actually in this community?” Put them all together and maybe it\r\n            will be realised that they constitute a greater percentage of the\r\n            population.\r\n          </p>\r\n        </div>\r\n        <div class=\"row\">\r\n          <p>\r\n            Advertising is a powerful source of communication. Sometimes even\r\n            more powerful than films. In order to sell something it convinces\r\n            people into believing something they do not believe in. That can be\r\n            a very significant move when it comes to creating awareness about\r\n            the rights of trans women - if done right. It is needless to point\r\n            out the obvious fact that recently, especially after JK Rowling’s\r\n            infamous rant about the transgender community, there is a need to\r\n            address the issues of trans women more than ever. And advertising\r\n            has the capability to do just that.\r\n          </p>\r\n        </div>\r\n      </div>\r\n    </div>\r\n\r\n    <section id=\"footer\"></section>\r\n    <script src=\"/42f69825340f0b5fa628d80900a46daa.js\"></script>\r\n  </body>\r\n</html>\r\n"},"sourceMaps":null,"error":null,"hash":"cdff52a8118ae8613910bd5a37c07c57","cacheData":{"env":{}}}
