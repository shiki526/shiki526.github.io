Despite the distance that separates us, we as youth all share the experience of receiving an education. However, in times like these, when a global pandemic by the name of COVID-19 has taken the world by storm, many of our daily activities are modified in hopes of keeping us safe whilst also attempting to maintain a sense of normalcy. The following collection of responses, written by some of the Detester team members, highlights what education looks like for youth in the United States. Visit <a style=\"text-decoration:underline;\" href=\"https://detester.org/publications/32ALookAtEducationPart1.html\">here</a> to read the set of responses about education outside of the United States. </p> </div> <div class=\"row\"> <h3>South Brunswick, NJ, USA</h3> <h4>Anshika, our website co-director:</h4> <p> As soon as there were rumors of lockdown starting in Australia, with a growing number of cases, my university started remote learning only in week 3 of the first semester of the year. The transformation was fairly smooth, and we were given one extra week of holiday to fully accommodate for this transition to online learning. My university has 40,000 students, so in my opinion, they handled it pretty well. Everyone got accustomed to Zoom tutorials pretty quickly and lecture recordings remained the same. Because I am pursuing a Bachelor of Arts degree, all of our assignments are virtual anyway, so there was no dramatic change to this aspect. The main difference is the fact that with tutorials being online, it became almost impossible to make friends in classes. Breakout rooms were extremely awkward, and I now dread being put into a breakout room. Since remote learning has started, I have not made any friends at university, which actually makes me pretty sad because it is my last year of uni and I wanted to be social this year. Furthermore, in my degree, I rely a lot on physical sources like books to do my research for all the essays I have to write, which comprise my main assignments. I felt a bit disadvantaged with fewer sources, but I managed to complete all my research by spending more time online searching for sources. The quality of education hasn’t gone down for me since I don’t have any practical aspects in my course. In fact, my grades actually improved during this semester and my overall average mark increased by quite a bit. Because of remote learning and quarantine, I stayed at home for much longer, and I was able to concentrate better on my work, which resulted in better grades. I’ve also discovered that the teaching staff for my subjects provided us with more support and resources than ever. I’ve had so many consultations during this past year from tutors, who were enthusiastic about helping me with assignments, which I’m beyond grateful for. This whole experience has had its ups and downs, but I’m more or less accustomed to online learning now. </p> </div> </div> </div> <section id=\"footer\"></section> <script src=\"/42f69825340f0b5fa628d80900a46daa.js\"></script> </body></html>"},"sourceMaps":null,"error":null,"hash":"f2815b53d2efa7205bc0c81122c87695","cacheData":{"env":{}}}
