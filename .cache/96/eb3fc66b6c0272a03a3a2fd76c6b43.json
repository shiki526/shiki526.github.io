He looks like he is\r\n          leaving the house very quietly. Almost escaping\r\n          like he is a 15-year old boy, but he is clearly\r\n          in his 30s. He looks at his phone waiting for\r\n          someone and he seems to be annoyed. When 'BOOM'\r\n          and massive earthquake hits.<br><br>\r\n          \r\n          GABRIEL ALEXIS\r\n          Oh fuck!\r\n          The earthquake ends.\r\n          <br><br>\r\n          GABRIEL ALEXIS\r\n          Ma!

I always\r\n          think of her as a superhero. Her superpower? Praying\r\n          and caring. She is the bad ass that she will make all\r\n          my drunken uncles pray during a party. She will\r\n          always pick the most \"lit\" moment of the party to\r\n          make everyone pray. People feel very assured by\r\n          people that pray. Years ago, our neighbor, Don Papo,\r\n          had a massive heart attack. He died on his living\r\n          room. His wife called 911 and immediately after, she\r\n          sent for my mom. My mom, my superhero... she will now\r\n          pray.<br><br>\r\n          DONA MARTA whips out her rosary like it is\r\n          Wonder Woman's whip.\r\n          <br><br>\r\n          DON GABRIEL\r\n          There you go.<br><br>\r\n          DON GABRIEL hands GABRIEL A. a flashlight, <br><br>DON\r\n          GABRIEL has many gadgets. <br><br>DON GABRIEL, a true\r\n          prep-er, has been ready for this.\r\n          <br><br>\r\n          GABRIEL ALEXIS\r\n          Dad: he thrives in these situations.

We were meeting at\r\n          4am to get a room that you pay by the hour. That does\r\n          not signal \"getting back together\" unless you are a\r\n          lesbian.<br><br>\r\n          JOSE ALBERTO\r\n          And I just got divorced...<br><br>\r\n          GABRIEL ALEXIS\r\n          Look Sophy's Choice, I only wanted us to have some\r\n          fun for old time sake.

Joe, you have been suppressing an important\r\n          part of yourself with that...<br><br>\r\n          DOÑA MARTA\r\n          Everyone! I think it is a good time for us to pray.<br><br>\r\n          GABRIEL ALEXIS\r\n          Mom! We just prayed; it is not a good time.\r\n          DOÑA MARTA (LOVING.)\r\n          That prayer already expired honey, we need to do\r\n          another one.<br><br>\r\n          GABRIEL ALEXIS\r\n          If that prayer expired, what are we going to do? Be\r\n          praying all day long?<br><br>\r\n          DOÑA MARTA\r\n          ...and that will be okay.<br><br>\r\n          GABRIEL ALEXIS\r\n          It is not like that is helping.<br><br>\r\n          DOÑA MARTA\r\n          Excuse you sir! Prayers kept us alive. What do you\r\n          think\r\n          <br><br>\r\n          9.\r\n          <br><br>\r\n          did? The government? After the Hurricane, we were\r\n          left off to fence for ourselves. We had to rescue the\r\n          few people that we could by ourselves. Do you think\r\n          the Puerto Rican government did anything? They were\r\n          out to get all they could steal. How about the United\r\n          States of America? That aid arrived here last week!\r\n          Two years later! What a shame! Our people served on\r\n          every war that the White men had. However, they did\r\n          not come when it was our time of need. Don't you tell\r\n          me that prayer is not helping! Prayer is the only\r\n          thing we got! Our prayers kept us alive!<br><br>\r\n          GABRIEL ALEXIS\r\n          You told me you guys were okay.<br><br>\r\n          DOÑA MARTA\r\n          Nobody could help honey. We were stocked in this\r\n          island and the bodies were piling up. What use could\r\n          it have done to tell you?<br><br>\r\n          GABRIEL ALEXIS\r\n          I am so sorry mom. I'll be there in second.\r\n          GABRIEL ALEXIS goes to JOSE ALBERTO. A strong\r\n          aftershock is felt/hear. GABRIEL ALEXIS and JOSE\r\n          ALBERTO kiss passionately. Everyone stops and\r\n          watch.<br><br>\r\n          \r\n          DOÑA MARTA (TO JOSÉ ALBERTO)\r\n          Don't worry honey, we all know.<br><br>\r\n          JOSE ALBERTO\r\n          What? Since when?<br><br>\r\n          DON GABRIEL\r\n          Since you were both little.<br><br>\r\n          GABRIEL ALEXIS\r\n          Go check on your parents okay? Oh... and take Auntie\r\n          Judith. Please.<br><br>\r\n          JOSE ALBERTO\r\n          Okay.<br><br>\r\n          JOSE ALBERTO and GABRIEL ALEXIS give each other\r\n          a peck.<br><br>\r\n          DON GABRIEL\r\n          I do have engagement rings for you two. I bought ten\r\n          years ago. Just let me know if you want them.\r\n          <br><br>\r\n          10.\r\n          <br><br>\r\n          GABRIEL ALEXIS\r\n          Oh dear. Dad stop!\r\n          A beat.<br><br>\r\n          GABRIEL ALEXIS\r\n          Mom, can we pray?<br><br>\r\n          DOÑA MARTA\r\n          Of course, nene. Come here.<br><br>\r\n          GABRIEL ALEXIS sits right next to his mom she\r\n          grabs his hand and she is carrying her rosary in\r\n          the other hand. She starts praying. <br><br>DON GABRIEL\r\n          grabs two beers hands one to GABRIEL ALEXIS.<br><br>\r\n          LAST IMAGE: GABRIEL ALEXIS is praying while\r\n          grabbing his mom's hand and a beer on the other\r\n          hand. <br><br>DON GABRIEL stands right next to him\r\n          having his beer and watching over them two.\r\n          <br><br>\r\n          -The End-\r\n          </p>\r\n        </div>\r\n        <div class=\"row\">\r\n            <h3>How does your work connect to the BLM movement or systemic racism?</h3>\r\n            <p class=\"italic\">\r\n              I work doing academic studies of the lack of inclusion in theatre education and media.
