It is currently legal for same-sex couples to get married across the United States and in 30 countries around the world. Society’s increasing acceptance of the LGBTQ+ community is due in part to the way that queer characters are slowly being integrated into books, movies, and television shows. For the past decade, queer characters had mostly been reserved for media intended for teenagers or adult viewers but, as of late, that notion seems to be changing.</p> <p>On August 15th, Disney announced that Luz Noceda, the main character of The Owl House, is canonically bisexual. The Owl House is one of Disney Channel’s newest animated shows, which follows Luz ‘The Human’ Noceda as she trains in another world to become a witch although she, herself, cannot perform magic in the same way that others at her school can. The show has been a huge hit and has acquired fans of all ages due to its entertaining plot and captivating world that viewers can immerse themselves in.</p> <p>The revelation that Luz is bisexual did not come as a surprise to many viewers who had likely already noted the growing relationship between Luz and one of her classmates. Dana Terrace, the show’s creator, recently confirmed that Amity Blight, a supporting character, is a lesbian. Terrace had adamantly wished to include LGBTQ+ characters in the main cast even before The Owl House was approved by the network. However, after it was greenlit by the studio, Terrace was told that she wouldn’t be allowed to have LGBTQ+ characters on the channel. Nevertheless, through her dedication to her cause and the support of some Disney leadership, Terrace was finally able to have a queer character in her story.</p> <p>There have, of course, been some who have contested Disney’s decision to have a queer character on one of its shows. Most of these opinions, however, are from people who are not part of the show’s fan base. For the most part, responses to the news have been overwhelmingly positive.</p> <p>Although there have been very few canonically queer cartoon characters in children’s media, there have been many queer coded cartoon characters over the years, Disney characters being some of the most overt examples of such. Disney villains have long since been regarded as queer coded characters due to their flamboyant personalities and the ‘effeminate’ way that male characters present themselves.</p> <p>Queer coding is not necessarily a negative thing per se. In many cases, it has been a way for creators to subtly incorporate LGBTQ+ characters into a piece without overtly stating so. In recent years, many have credited General Li Shang from the 1998 film Mulan with being a queer icon despite the fact that his sexuality was never explicitly stated in the movie. This is due to the fact that he displays a clear level of attraction to Mulan when she is still disguised as Fa Ping which leads many to believe that Shang is bisexual.</p> <p>However, queer coded characters, specifically men, have often been antagonistic characters, shrewdly conveying to audiences that presenting as what people have historically defined as queer is wrong, as the idea of effeminate men and masculine women went against the grain and opposed society’s strong fixation on traditional gender roles. In more current media, the ways in which characters may present as queer aren’t as pejorative. Nevertheless, there are still problems with queer coding characters, specifically when queer coding leads to queerbaiting.</p> <p>Queerbaiting is when a show or movie will allude to characters being LGBTQ+, usually insinuating that two characters of the same sex will end up in a relationship when there is no intention of making anything canon. It is a malicious marketing technique that preys on a community that almost never sees itself represented in media in order to build a larger fanbase.</p> <p>One example of queerbaiting can be seen in the Dreamworks Netflix original show Voltron: Legendary Defender, which made its debut in 2016 as a reboot of the original 1980s television show Voltron. There were multiple examples of queerbaiting during the show’s two year run, which made many fans of the show incredibly upset. For one, it was revealed at a panel during the 2017 San Diego Comic Con that one of their main characters, Takashi Shirogane, was gay and that his fiance would be introduced in the 7th season. Fans were disappointed when not only was it unclear that the two men were even in a relationship, but Shiro’s fiance was barely on screen–in a flashback, at that– before it was revealed that he had died. Their disappointment and irritation did not wane when they watched Shiro get married to a character that he had hardly interacted with during the show in a throwaway scene in the very last few seconds of the last episode. It was not the representation that fans were led to believe they would be watching, and they were rightly upset.</p> <p>Disney has had many “first” gay characters over the years, Le Fou from the live action Beauty and the Beast, Oaken from Frozen, and Officer Specter from Pixar’s Onward to name a few. However, many would argue that these characters hardly count as real representation. With many of them, the fact that they were queer was incredibly subtle; with Le Fou, many thought that when Josh Gad played the character, he would do something differently than he did in the animated movie which was largely not the case. With Oaken, the appearance of his husband in the film went unnoticed by most viewers. In Officer Specter’s case, she does outright say she has a girlfriend, but in some international dubs of the movie, the word “girlfriend” is replaced with “partner”. While the small moments of inclusivity are by all means important and a definite step in the right direction, there is still much work to be done.</p> <p>The LGBTQ+ community continues to face many issues stemming from a lack of understanding and support, one of the most damaging ones being homelessness. A Missed Opportunities: National Estimates survey on homeless youth found that young adults who identify as part of the LGBTQ+ community had a 120 percent greater risk of homelessness than those who were straight or cisgender. One in 30 individuals who were between the ages of 13 and 17 had experienced homelessness at some point in their lives, and for individuals between the ages of 18 and 25, the number was raised to one in 10.</p> <p>Additionally, LGBTQ+ youth are disproportionately victims of suicide. The Report of the 2015 U.S. Transgender Survey from the National Center for Transgender Equality has found that between LGBTQ+ teens face a suicide rate that is about five times greater than that of their heterosexual peers.</p> <p>Both of these issues are undoubtedly crippling to LGBTQ+ youth and are largely due to the rejection that youth experience from their parents and families. In an article titled “The Influence of Families on LGBTQ Youth Health: A Call to Action for Innovation in Research and Intervention Development”, the United States National Library of Medicine determined that there is a strong correlation between familial rejection and an array of mental health issues as well as suicidality, substance abuse, and sexual risks.</p> <p>There is also significant correlation between mental health issues and the lack of representation in media. For the most part, very fit and attractive gay white men were the extent of LGBTQ+ characters in media. This in itself has contributed to the incredibly crippling body-focused culture that has been a blight on the community and has led to the ever rampant eating disorder epidemic that all too many people in the community have faced. The National Eating Disorders Association has determined that LGBTQ+ teens as young as 12 years old often begin to develop eating disorders and that more than 4o percent of all men who have eating disorders are gay.</p> <p>There are other factors that contribute to these disorders, but one of the most prevalent ones is that people in the LGBTQ+ rarely see themselves represented in the media. They often feel the need to conform to the singular type of character that they can relate to, which highlights why having a wide array of characters to relate to, especially characters of color, is so important.</p> <p>In recent years, there have been multiple depictions of same sex couples, as well as gender queer characters, in childrens’ television shows. In 2018, Cartoon Network’s Steven Universe featured the first lesbian engagement and wedding in a cartoon, and the Dreamworks Netflix original show She-Ra and the Princesses of Power featured the first lesbian protaganists and one of the first nonbinary characters in a cartoon. Having children and teenagers be able to see characters in shows that they regularly watch and relate to is an incredibly powerful thing. However, it should be noted that Disney featuring its first bisexual character, who is also a person of color, is something that holds more weight.</p> <p>Disney has been historically regarded as having a monopoly on childhood entertainment due to its widespread popularity. Its movies and television shows have enraptured people of all ages internationally for several generations. Having a Dominican LGBTQ+ character in a Disney show is incredibly important because not only is it a character for children to relate to, it also teaches parents to be more accepting of the LGBTQ+ community.</p> <p>“The Parasocial Contact Hypothesis” by Edward Schiappa, Peter B. Gregg, and Dean E. Hewes explains that when people are given the chance to observe individuals or ideas that they hold prejudices against in movies and television shows which allows them to develop a greater level of understanding, they are more likely to become more accepting and lose some of their biases towards that community. In other words, seeing a queer person of color in children’s media may very well allow parents to become more open and accepting people.</p> <p>Change is inevitable. First, there was a rise in female characters in media doing more than just being confined to the home. Then, people of different races, especially Black people, began receiving positive representation in likeable characters that they could relate to. Both helped shape society into a more accepting place for everyone. Now, people of the LGBTQ+ community are finally getting the chance to see themselves on screen in every way. Hopefully, Luz Noceda will be the first of many LGBTQ+ main characters that Disney puts out into the world as we usher in a new and more welcoming era.</p> </div> </div> </div>  <section id=\"footer\"></section> <script src=\"/42f69825340f0b5fa628d80900a46daa.js\"></script> </body></html>"},"sourceMaps":null,"error":null,"hash":"a5da7450d123797b79f5fc36fc934c11","cacheData":{"env":{}}}
