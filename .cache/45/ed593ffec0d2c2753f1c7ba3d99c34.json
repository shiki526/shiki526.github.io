Emergency within an Emergency <h3 class=\"author\">By: Shreya Margale</h3> </div> <div class=\"textBlock page-section\"> <div class=\"row\"> <p> In Yemen, the integrated impact of more than 5 years of socio-political conflict between the Hadi-led Yemeni government and Houthi armed movement, economic decline, and institutional collapse has left 24 million people – about two-thirds of the population – in need of humanitarian aid and protection.This long-running conflict involves Houthi rebels (aligned with the former President Saleh) and a pro-government institution supported by a military coalition led by Saudi Arabia and UAE. </p> </div> <div class=\"row\"> <p> The crisis has reached cataclysmic proportions, and with COVID-19 exacerbating living conditions and spreading cross-country, sanitation and clean water are in short supply. Furthermore, with a famine threatening thousands of lives and thousands of children suffering from malnutrition, Yemen requires the utmost attention of younger masses, in terms of donations, petitions, and spreading the word. Ideally, countries and their governments should be pushing lucrative legislation, monetary and humanitarian assistance, as well as mediate the considered conflict. However, inaction by a majority of states is evident: to shed light on these atrocities and highlight youth voices pushing for tangible action, the aforementioned tasks, in addition to being accurately informed can go a long way. </p> </div> <div class=\"row\"> <p> As a result, UNICEF has declared Yemen’s ongoing dissension as the world’s largest humanitarian crisis. Ignorance is the stagnation of innovative solutions, which is why recognizing and working towards alleviating Yemen’s humanitarian crisis through social media activism, online articles, and word of mouth is of utmost importance. Specifically considering social media, it can be a vessel to transform knowledge into tangible action: sharing accurate information, linking petitions, donations and valid newsreels can help educate, empathize and create opportunities for the youth to strive for social justice. Often, constant exposure to news on social media allows individuals to take the conversation beyond an app, into the confines of their home and communities, especially if the issue has not been addressed in the media. Sadly, the Yemen crisis does not get NEARLY enough media coverage that it deserves, as #BlackLivesMatter is a current focal point (as it should be, but we need to prioritize Yemen too). Therefore, please read the following article and inform yourselves: and do your part in donating, and sharing accurate information over social media. </p> </div> <div class=\"row\"> <h3>10 Facts You Need to Know:</h3> <p> 1. The humanitarian situation is still the worst in the world, with 24 million people in need of assistance. </p> <p> 2. Every 10 minutes, a child under the age of 5 dies of preventable causes. </p> <p>3. Approximately 3 million people have been displaced.</p> <p> 4. Around 18 million Yemenis don’t have access to safe drinking water and cases of cholera have surged. </p> <p> 5. Humanitarian response faces a funding gap of nearly 2 million dollars. </p> <p> 6. The conflict has resulted in the deaths of more than 100,000 people, including over 20,000 civilians, and has forced 3.65 million people to flee. </p> <p> 7. In 21 days (tracking from 19th June) Yemen will run out of oil, a necessity for basic household activities and a major export commodity. A majority of underfunded hospitals will shut down, and there will be a scarcity of clean water. </p> <p> In 111 days (tracking from 19th June), Yemen will run out of rice and in 97 days will run out of wheat. </p> <p> 9. In the past 15 minutes, a child in Yemen passed away. Another child will die in the next 15, and another after that, and after that. </p> </div> <div class=\"row\"> <img src=\"/228db4811cc23235d451e8624701ed73.png\" alt=\"\"> <img src=\"/aa2b17180d195a55336c34f1a170b9e8.png\" alt=\"\"> <img src=\"/da4d0462c59bc051a451d1128c4052f2.png\" alt=\"\"> </div> </div> </div> <section id=\"footer\"></section> <script src=\"/42f69825340f0b5fa628d80900a46daa.js\"></script> </body></html>"},"sourceMaps":null,"error":null,"hash":"2c8395f806e73dec53f0d5ed34df990d","cacheData":{"env":{}}}
