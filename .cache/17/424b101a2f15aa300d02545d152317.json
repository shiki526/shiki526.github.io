We've wanted to collab for\r\n                    years by doing something around celebrating Black women. We created this series to represent fem Black\r\n                    bodies of all shapes, focusing on plus-sized bodies. We also wanted to illustrate the beauty of 4c\r\n                    hair because it's still seen negatively in society and within our communities. These ideas stem from\r\n                    my Mom not feeling represented as a plus-sized/curvy Black woman and my experiences with self-hate\r\n                    regarding my hair and what I perceived as body flaws. Additionally, we don't like how dark-skinned\r\n                    Black women are treated negatively in media, so most of the art in this series will show the beauty of\r\n                    dark skin. The background and hair colors are taken from her ClarityIsJustSoHip designs, while I drew\r\n                    the bodies.\r\n                  </p>\r\n                </div>\r\n              </div>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"mySlides\">\r\n              <div class=\"art-container\">\r\n                <div class=\"numbertext\">3 / 5</div>\r\n                <img class=\"popup-img\" src=\"/447512b681f91bfe6e89ea338f2f797c.png\" style=\"width: 100%\">\r\n                <div class=\"textBlock\">\r\n  \r\n                  <div class=\"sub\">Artist: Amaranthia Sepia</div>\r\n                  <p>\r\n                    \"Conflicted\" is a redraw of an older drawing with the same name that I drew at age 11. The original\r\n                    was drawn when racism and bullying were beginning to worsen for my family and me in my majority white\r\n                    community. It's about my conflict being a Black girl in a country I love but doesn't love me back. The\r\n                    redraw was made to reflect how the pain I feel has grown and not changed primarily because of how\r\n                    America treats Black women and our voices, especially regarding police brutality, racial and\r\n                    non-racial violence (physical and psychological.) Unfortunately, I've dealt with patriarchal mindsets\r\n                    in my own Black family, where I've experienced constant silencing and censorship around Black women's\r\n                    suffering. As a result, I thought these issues didn't occur to Black women. When bullying based in\r\n                    misogynoir occurred at school, I felt that I should censor myself because my mindset was 'what happens\r\n                    to Black girls isn't as bad.' It wasn't until around age 11 that my Mom and I slowly became aware,\r\n                    which led to her encouraging me to make the first \"Conflicted.\" Now with the recent BLM movement, I've\r\n                    become hyper-aware of painful, disheartening statistics around hyper-sexualization of Black girls,\r\n                    high suspension rates/criminalization of Black girls and women, and domestic violence.\r\n                  </p>\r\n                </div>\r\n              </div>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"mySlides\">\r\n              <div class=\"art-container\">\r\n                <div class=\"numbertext\">4 / 5</div>\r\n                <img class=\"popup-img\" src=\"/447512b681f91bfe6e89ea338f2f797c.png\" style=\"width: 100%\">\r\n                <div class=\"textBlock\">\r\n  \r\n                  <div class=\"sub\">Artist: Amaranthia Sepia</div>\r\n                  <p>\r\n                    Mainstream media portrays police profiling as a male experience, which results in people not\r\n                    recognizing this occurs to Black women at the same rate (via African American Policy Forum.)\r\n                    Additionally, Black girls and women who are murdered by police are usually not investigated or\r\n                    counted.
