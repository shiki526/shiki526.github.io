              The COVID-19 pandemic has pushed billions of people into
              unprecedented situations, forcing them to adapt both abruptly and
              quickly. Racism has also accentuated the mental health crisis of
              many BIPOC. As a result, the mental health of individuals across
              the globe has been significantly impacted by COVID-19, yet it is
              an overlooked issue. We at Detester Magazine recognize how
              stressful these circumstances must be for many. We will host an
              international open discussion in addition to a mental health guide
              to understand the impact of the pandemic and racial injustice on
              the mental health of youth. <br>
              <br>Join our international open discussion on
              <b>September 27th, 2020</b> at <b>4PM PST/ 7 PM EST</b> to discuss
              how COVID-19 and racism have influenced our mental health. Meet
              our panelists below. They will share mental health advice and
              answer your questions live. Sign up for the panel to learn about
              ways to address mental health stigma and support mental health
              during this difficult time!

            up in an aesthetic sport, I faced constant pressure to maintain a

            years recovered, I am sharing my story in the hopes that I can cause

            through."
