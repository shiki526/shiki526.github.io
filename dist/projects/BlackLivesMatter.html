              This piece is in remembrance of the late rapper, Pop Smoke. His

              and became one of my favorite artists during latter half of 2019.
              I felt with creating this animated illustration/short, I could

                    Looking at this piece... what do you see? Do you just see a
                    mere face, the choked eyes, or the hypnotic hands? Do you
                    wonder... why the zipper and denim stitches on the face?
                    Maybe it's alot deeper than what you see... Different
                    experiences in life can be vexatious or rosy. Life they say
                    is not a bed of roses. When the hard part hits you, it feels
                    like the entire universe is against you, everything seems
                    like a gigantic burden choking and pulling you down from
                    every angle, depression kicks in, you try to zip it all up,
                    it seems unachievable. You feel Like giving up already. But
                    most importantly, how you handle such tragedy matters a
                    great deal, do you let it own you or you fight hard to
                    conquer it. 'Life in general is 10% what happens to you, the
                    other 90% is how you handle it'.

                    I'm a Black, disabled, mental health advocate who deals with
                    invisible illness (GAD, PTSD, agoraphobia due to racial
                    trauma). My recent work focuses on disparities Black people
                    face in mental healthcare treatment and misogynoir. My
                    educational activism series "Surviving in Isolation: The
                    Black Mental Health Experience" highlights how Black people
                    don't see themselves represented when seeking a therapist or
                    psychologist. It also illustrates my own experiences with
                    racism while seeking treatment. When POC seek mental
                    healthcare, they're more likely to get lower quality
                    treatment and more likely to end treatment (article,
                    "Talking About Race in Trauma Psychotherapy" via
                    societyforpsychotherapy.org). A 2014 study by AIU showed
                    that out of 35 African-Americans and 15 Hispanics, 82%
                    reported communication issues related to race with a
                    non-ethnic/Caucasian therapist. APA.org stated as of 2015,
                    only 4% of psychologists are Black/African-American.

                    "Celebrating Shades of Black Beauty "is a new series I
                    started with my Mom. We've wanted to collab for years by
                    doing something around celebrating Black women. We created
                    this series to represent fem Black bodies of all shapes,
                    focusing on plus-sized bodies. We also wanted to illustrate
                    the beauty of 4c hair because it's still seen negatively in
                    society and within our communities. These ideas stem from my
                    Mom not feeling represented as a plus-sized/curvy Black
                    woman and my experiences with self-hate regarding my hair
                    and what I perceived as body flaws. Additionally, we don't
                    like how dark-skinned Black women are treated negatively in
                    media, so most of the art in this series will show the
                    beauty of dark skin. The background and hair colors are
                    taken from her ClarityIsJustSoHip designs, while I drew the
                    bodies.

                    "Conflicted" is a redraw of an older drawing with the same
                    name that I drew at age 11. The original was drawn when
                    racism and bullying were beginning to worsen for my family
                    and me in my majority white community. It's about my
                    conflict being a Black girl in a country I love but doesn't
                    love me back. The redraw was made to reflect how the pain I
                    feel has grown and not changed primarily because of how
                    America treats Black women and our voices, especially
                    regarding police brutality, racial and non-racial violence
                    (physical and psychological.) Unfortunately, I've dealt with
                    patriarchal mindsets in my own Black family, where I've
                    experienced constant silencing and censorship around Black
                    women's suffering. As a result, I thought these issues
                    didn't occur to Black women. When bullying based in
                    misogynoir occurred at school, I felt that I should censor
                    myself because my mindset was 'what happens to Black girls
                    isn't as bad.' It wasn't until around age 11 that my Mom and
                    I slowly became aware, which led to her encouraging me to
                    make the first "Conflicted." Now with the recent BLM
                    movement, I've become hyper-aware of painful, disheartening
                    statistics around hyper-sexualization of Black girls, high
                    suspension rates/criminalization of Black girls and women,
                    and domestic violence.

                    Mainstream media portrays police profiling as a male
                    experience, which results in people not recognizing this
                    occurs to Black women at the same rate (via African American
                    Policy Forum.) Additionally, Black girls and women who are
                    murdered by police are usually not investigated or counted.
                    Andrea Ritchie, one of the authors of the #sayhername
                    report, stated, "Women's experiences of policing and
                    criminalization and resistance become unworthy of historical
                    study or mention, particularly when those writing our
                    histories are also men." (article, " #SayHerName-Police
                    Violence Against Black Women and Girls: An Interview with
                    Andrea J. Ritchie," via aaihs.org). Statistics and research
                    like this led me to recreate "Conflicted' nine years later."

                    The image of my artwork shows two hands of different tones
                    grasping each other in a firm handshake beneath a statement
                    “We stand with you”. Below where the hands of different

                    The arms individually represent their differences just by
                    their tones and the grab of the handshake implies unity,
                    diplomatic agreement, and a shared strength of power and
                    support. The statement above the image gives a further
                    implication of the desire of support and strength for the
                    BIPOC community that requires it the most in this moment.

                    We support the BLM movement through cultural action,
                    reflecting on subtle moments of isolation caused because of
                    the political current scenario in the US. The result is a
                    poetic collection of art postcards supporting the BLM. Just
                    like we tend to share relevant news for the community, this
                    postcards could be printed and shared amid black people as a
                    peace-oriented sign of empowement for all.

                    Neutrality utilizes an image from the 2017 Women's March and
                    a quote by South African human rights activist Desmond Tutu
                    as tools for creative intervention. As the image utilizes
                    text, it is able to speak for itself. But to provide further
                    context, this phrase is a call to action and is especially
                    important in today's current socio-political climate. I
                    chose to use an image from the 2017 Women's March as this
                    event brought together a variety of different people to
                    protest a wide variety of social and political issues. While
                    the main theme was feminism, a range of protest signs are
                    visible, including anti-racism, equality, resistance,
                    climate change advocacy, queer liberation, and more. This
                    quote is able to capture the resistance necessary in regards
                    to the wide variety of issues marginalized groups face and
                    for those who stand in solidarity.
