            This was just a fun piece for me to draw because I love to draw curvier body types and I believe that they
            also deserve to represented as beautiful. Just because someone is bigger does not mean they have to be
            ugly
            until they lose weight, beauty comes in all sizes. I added vitiligo just for that extra step in inclusion
            and
            diversity.

            I drew this right around the time of Blackout Tuesday. This was meant to show my solidarity to the cause
            and I used the caption to speak up about my opinions on the hypocrisy of the art community surrounding
            BIPOC.

            This was a redraw of a piece I did in late 2019. It shows how much I have improved as an artist and that
            even
            when
            you think your art has peaked and that you’ve made your best work, there’s always room for improvement. I
            know
            that
            my dedication to my craft is paying off as i continue to watch my improvements over time.

          1. Introduce yourself!
        </h4>
      </div>
      <p>
        I’m a 19 year old digital artist. I’ve been doing art as long as I’ve been alive but only got into it
        seriously
        at
        the beginning of high school. I was born, raised, and continue to live in a suburban town in the north GTA. I
        did
        live in ottawa for a few months while i attended the university of ottawa (first year cut short due to
        coved-19)
        my cultural background is Trinidadian as i am a first generation Canadian on my dads side and second gen on my
        moms.
      </p>

      <div class="row">
        <h4 class="mohogany">
          2. How have you identified yourself as a BIPOC individual through your creative work?
        </h4>
      </div>
      <p>
        By drawing other POC as well as trying to bring my culture into my art and writing. Not long ago, I also
        started
        a
        podcast (Midnight Mayhem) with a friend from Colombia where we occasionally talk about our culture and
        traditions.
      </p>

      <div class="row">
        <h4 class="mohogany">
          3. How has your creative work allowed you to express yourself?
        </h4>
      </div>
      <p>
        I love bringing color into the world. My art allows me to share my perspective and give the world a dreamlike
        quality I wish it had. One of my favorite things to draw are faces; I love finding beauty in people and
        conveying
        emotion through their expressions.
      </p>

      <div class="row">
        <h4 class="mohogany">
          4. What is your stance on BIPOC representation in the media?
        </h4>
      </div>
      <p>
        I think it is slowly getting better but I hope that with the BLM movement people open their eyes to all the
        changes that have to be made. I’ve recently found a couple of shows such as Gentefied, that finally showcases
        latinos as real people and not just a side character or stereotype.
      </p>

      <div class="row">
        <h4 class="mohogany">
          5. How has your culture influenced your work and who you are today?
        </h4>
      </div>
      <p>
        It has made me the hardworking individual that I am today. The warmth and colorful culture back home
        definitely
        shows on my color palette choices most of the time.
      </p>

      <div class="row">
        <h4 class="mohogany">
          6. What do you like to do in your free time?
        </h4>
      </div>
      <div class="spacing">
        <p>
          Besides art I love to dance ballet, read, cook, and go for long walks.
