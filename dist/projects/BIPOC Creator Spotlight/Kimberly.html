              This is the piece I am the most proud of. I wanted to recreate the mood of a park in China, and add a koi

              I always loved her dress ever since the movie came out. I’ve drawn it many times since. This is a piece
              that
              means a lot to me because I think it really shows my improvement over the years, and how much working on
              my
              passion has paid off.

            1. Introduce yourself!
          </h4>
        </div>
        <p>
          I am a Filipina aspiring animator and illustrator raised in China! I moved to Canada to attend college and to
          pursue art. I attended Vancouver Film School last year and am currently attending Algonquin College in Ottawa.
        </p>

        <div class="row">
          <h4 class="mohogany">
            2. How have you identified yourself as a BIPOC individual through your creative work?
          </h4>
        </div>
        <p>
          I try to incorporate my Chinese background into as many pieces as I can. I love recreating the mood and
          tranquility that China has always given me growing up. In addition, I try to incorporate my family’s Filipino
          culture into my works.
        </p>

        <div class="row">
          <h4 class="mohogany">
            3. How has your creative work allowed you to express yourself?
          </h4>
        </div>
        <p>
          It allows me to show my love for certain media and characters through my fanart. It also allows me to create
          new
          stories and characters that mean a lot to me, inspired because of the way that I grew up.
        </p>

        <div class="row">
          <h4 class="mohogany">
            4. What is your stance on BIPOC representation in the media?
          </h4>
        </div>
        <p>
          I believe that we definitely need more representation, as an example for younger BIPOC and as a way to learn
          about each other as equals.
        </p>

        <div class="row">
          <h4 class="mohogany">
            5. How has your culture influenced your work and who you are today?
          </h4>
        </div>
        <p>
          I like to believe that my culture has certainly influenced my approach on art. Growing up attending an
          International School in China, I was exposed to many cultures and views. I think that it gives me a unique and
          international quality as an artist.

            6. What do you like to do in your free time?
          </h4>
        </div>
        <p>
          Drawing, working out, reading and cooking are some of my favourite hobbies.
        </p>
