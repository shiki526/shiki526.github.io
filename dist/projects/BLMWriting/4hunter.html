            <h3>How does your work connect to the BLM movement or systemic racism?</h3>
            <p class="italic">
                The strings which attach my work to the systematic racism that politicizes my body are tethered. In my poetry, I often find myself "freestyling" through my hands onto the keyboard or into the pen. Where the reality of alienation and gravity of oppression sinks itself into my words. It's one of the only mediums in which I can have a dialogue with my blood and my history primordially. Within the last three years, my family and I have lost six of our loved ones, nearly all were tragic. Most recently COVID-19 took the lives of my Grandpa and Uncle Jose. At 20 years old, meditating with mourning and melancholia has never felt more valuable. From an even larger picture, between viruses and bureaucratic brutality, it feels as if grief is an inescapable truth of black consciousness. A truth which has touched my life deeply in the these last quick years of youth. Although, within my infatuation with death I find an undaunting certainty at the end of my imagination. My writing allows me to weave and work through these issues as new traumas present themselves to me through technology, grief, and time.
