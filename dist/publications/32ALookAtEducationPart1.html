            The Detester Team is composed of youth from around the globe.
            Despite the distance that separates us, we as youth all share the
            experience of receiving an education. However, in times like these,
            when a global pandemic by the name of COVID-19 has taken the world
            by storm, many of our daily activities are modified in hopes of
            keeping us safe whilst also attempting to maintain a sense of
            normalcy. The following collection of responses, written by some of
            the Detester team members, highlights what education looks like for
            youth around the world. These responses provide not only an overview
            of the current models of learning that have been designed in
            response to the pandemic, but also our experiences, concerns and
            hopes for the future. In the coming days, we will post another set
            of responses that addresses education in the United States.

          <h3>Melbourne, Australia</h3>
          <h4>Lindsay, our staff writer:</h4>
          <p>
            As soon as there were rumors of lockdown starting in Australia, with
            a growing number of cases, my university started remote learning
            only in week 3 of the first semester of the year. The transformation
            was fairly smooth, and we were given one extra week of holiday to
            fully accommodate for this transition to online learning. My
            university has 40,000 students, so in my opinion, they handled it
            pretty well. Everyone got accustomed to Zoom tutorials pretty
            quickly and lecture recordings remained the same. Because I am
            pursuing a Bachelor of Arts degree, all of our assignments are
            virtual anyway, so there was no dramatic change to this aspect. The
            main difference is the fact that with tutorials being online, it
            became almost impossible to make friends in classes. Breakout rooms
            were extremely awkward, and I now dread being put into a breakout
            room. Since remote learning has started, I have not made any friends
            at university, which actually makes me pretty sad because it is my
            last year of uni and I wanted to be social this year. Furthermore,
            in my degree, I rely a lot on physical sources like books to do my
            research for all the essays I have to write, which comprise my main
            assignments. I felt a bit disadvantaged with fewer sources, but I
            managed to complete all my research by spending more time online
            searching for sources. The quality of education hasn’t gone down for
            me since I don’t have any practical aspects in my course. In fact,
            my grades actually improved during this semester and my overall
            average mark increased by quite a bit. Because of remote learning
            and quarantine, I stayed at home for much longer, and I was able to
            concentrate better on my work, which resulted in better grades. I’ve
            also discovered that the teaching staff for my subjects provided us
            with more support and resources than ever. I’ve had so many
            consultations during this past year from tutors, who were
            enthusiastic about helping me with assignments, which I’m beyond
            grateful for. This whole experience has had its ups and downs, but
            I’m more or less accustomed to online learning now.

          <h3>Toronto, Canada</h3>
          <h4>Harvi, our staff editor:</h4>
          <p>
            Due to Canada’s management of the virus, I believe the upcoming
            2020-2021 school year will be effective and safe. My school
            encompasses around 2,500 students. This number is abnormally large
            for most Ontario secondary schools. The available models of learning
            in Ontario include a hybrid learning model or a fully online model
            of learning for the first semester only. The hybrid learning model
            entails having Monday, Wednesday, and Friday as in-class school
            days; Tuesday and Thursday are online. The in-class school days are
            only three hours long. On the other hand, the fully online model
            will allow students to stay home for the entire week for the first
            semester. I personally find the fully at-home model more safe and
            effective for me. I believe the quality of remote education is less
            effective than in-class education because of the difference in
            knowledge retainment when in a classroom setting versus being at
            home. Although I believe in-school education is better at teaching
            me, the mental health state of students during school days is way
            worse than them doing the work at home. Mental health disorders,
            such as depression, are at all time highs during the middle of the
            school semester. Most students I have talked to about online
            learning/remote learning have stated that they feel at ease and have
            better time to process information at their own pace when the
            content is online. They also feel less pressured when asking
            questions and learning content by themselves which is why their
            mental health state and confidence are at ease. I also believe that
            hybrid learning will mean that many students will be in close
            proximity with each other or prolonged periods of time, which can
            cause the rate of infection to rise significantly as the new
            semester starts. Because I am a senior, I have to worry about
            university applications which will be harder for me to complete if I
            cannot see my guidance counsellor and speak to my teachers about
            recommendations and evaluations. In my opinion, grade 12 students
            are at most risk due to this pandemic because of the rigidness of
            deadlines for university applications. Because students are given
            the opportunity to choose between online and hybrid learning, this
            means class sizes will naturally be smaller because of the shortage
            of students in school. Additionally, masks are mandatory in schools,
            but I believe this rule will not be upheld as properly as authority
            and political figures believe it will. High school students will
            likely not follow the orders of keeping their masks on and social
            distancing with one another at all times which is why the number of
            COVID-19 cases will definitely increase due to hybrid learning. The
            Ministry of Education should have decided to make the whole semester
            online rather than having hybrid learning as an option.

          <h3>Vancouver, Canada</h3>
          <h4>Suzanna, our staff writer:</h4>
          <p>
            Due to my community's relatively successful attempt at "flattening
            the curve" of reported COVID-19 cases, we hope to fully return to
            in-person instruction for the upcoming school term in September. Our
            school board's plan states that all schools can revert to
            "normality," and even wearing a mask would be optional for both
            students and staff. However, this proposal sparked extensive
            controversy due to its inflexibility and disregard for the
            continuing emotional impact that the pandemic has on some students
            and their families. Specific classes where students would have close
            encounters, including physical education, evoke broad concern as
            well. Many argue for alterations such as making attendances
            optional, preserving the pre-existing online platform (Microsoft
            Teams) for those unable to attend, leaving room for each school to
            decide solutions based on their respective circumstances, and
            requiring personal protective equipment for all school staff.
            Personally, as much as I anticipate "waking up" from this nightmare
            of social distancing, I am not in favour of a complete reopening of
            schools. The mere thought of making my way through a hallway of
            crowded bodies is anxiety-provoking. As the current conversation
            between the board and the public proceeds, it remains unclear
            whether the officials will acknowledge our concerns and amend their
            overly restrictive plan. I hope that they will, as safety and health
            should always be prioritized, even in front of education.

          <h3>New Delhi, India</h3>
          <h4>Mahi, our graphic designer:</h4>
          <p>
            I attend one of the largest universities in the world, in terms of
            student population, with around 400,000 students enrolled across
            various programs. Like in all other schools and universities across
            India, we are following remote learning with no clear indication as
            to when or if in the near future we will go back to in person
            learning.We had our end semester examinations in May and were hence
            promoted without any examination on the basis of performance in the
            previous semesters as well as on various assignments and impromptu
            online quizzes. However, senior year students are being forced to
            write the Open Book Exams (OBEs) to get their degrees. Filled with
            tons of instructions, guidelines and regulations, the OBEs ensure
            that everyone gets a "fair chance" which is just a moral grey area
            to me in more ways than one. These senior year students are losing
            their spots in Foreign Universities due the inability to send in
            their grades for the last semester and are losing their chance at
            various job opportunities as well and are undoubtedly adding to the
            unemployment rate of India. They have signed several petitions and
            written several letters to the prime minister and president of the
            country who are both alumni of the same university but have turned
            their backs on their own Alma mater. The Indian Government is keen
            on NOT making 2020 a zero academic year, however, zero efforts have
            been made. Online classes on Zoom, Google Meet or Microsoft Teams
            are not a feasible option as many students don't own a cell phone,
            let alone a laptop or iPad. The Bandwidth in India is also too low
            for students in certain areas of "Diplomatic" and "National
            Security" to attend online classes for reasons primarily being not
            having stable internet connection.

          <h3>Lima, Peru</h3>
          <h4>Vasco, our project manager:</h4>
          <p>
            When the first case of Coronavirus was confirmed in Peru, the
            President's primary measure was to close all schools. It is
            important to note that the school year starts in March and ends in
            December. Just days later, the county's borders were shut, curfews
            were imposed, and people could leave their homes for essential goods
            only. The mandatory lockdown lasted around four months, making it
            the longest in the world. Still, the cases kept rising every day; we
            are among the countries with the most deaths per million. Schools
            are not going to reopen anytime soon. Private schools constitute 26%
            of all the schools, and so the annual tuition can go from 300
            dollars a year to 15,000 dollars a year. Many poverty-stricken
            parents who had sent their kids to the cheapest private schools lost
            their jobs and decided to transfer their kids to public schools. At
            least 66% of private schools have been forced to close. The private
            schools of middle and upper-class citizens have started teaching
            with Zoom and other online video conference platforms like Google
            Meets, Google classroom, and Microsoft Teams. Most of these schools
            have also reduced their fees. On the other hand, public schools have
            closed and are not teaching online because many students do not have
            internet connection in their homes. As a solution to continue
            educating students, the Peruvian government created a program called
            "Aprendo en Casa". This program provides a tv show that teaches
            math, science, language, and civics to kids from 1st to 11th grade.
            Additionally, the government is sending brochures on math, science,
            language arts, and civics to homes in the poorer districts of the
            country so that students can learn a little more. All universities,
            public and private, are imparting online classes with video
            conference platforms as well.

          <h3>England, United Kingdom</h3>
          <h4>Asma, our social media manager:</h4>
          <p>
            I just finished secondary school which meant I was due to sit my
            GCSE exams, however, due to lockdown being enforced in March, I was
            unable to sit my official exams this year. The government and the
            exam board regulator of the country proposed an algorithm to hand
            out grades in a supposedly fair way but when A-level results came
            out, it turned out to be a postcode lottery, meaning the area you
            lived in hugely influenced the grades you wanted. This resulted in
            many smart students that came from disadvantaged backgrounds to be
            unfairly downgraded while private schools saw a surge in top marks.
            The unqualified education secretary insisted that no U-turn decision
            would be made unlike Scootland, however, after public outrage,
            massive student protests, union legal pursuits, and teenagers
            blocking parliament, they finally gave in and allowed centre
            assessed grades (CAGs) to be given out. This was incredibly
            embarrassing for the government and highlighted the Tory
            government’s utter incompetence regarding the handling of
            Coronavirus. The effect of every 16 and 18 year old in the country
            was detrimental to their mental health, especially in such
            unprecedented times, and the unnecessary stress and anxiety
            inflicted upon us were cruel, as well. College and University
            admissions are a mess this year, making it harder for people to
            secure places in clearing due to a delay in BTEC results that I am
            missing. We are expected to go back to school next week full-time
            with in-person classes and, unfortunately, no parent has the right
            to withdraw their child from school. You are not allowed to wear a
            mask as it will be impossible to enforce social distancing at
            British schools. As a result, we have been put into year bubbles
            where you can freely be with people in the same year as you.
            However, different years can still intermingle at break, lunch, in
            corridors and outside of school. The UK is officially out of total
            lockdowns nationally, however, many cities with a high number of
            cases are getting localised lockdowns. The number of deaths are
            highly inaccurate as they exclude deaths in communities and care
            homes as well as people who were only suspected but not confirmed of
            having the virus, making it easier for the government to hide the
            real death toll. Despite this, experts estimated there to be 64,000
            cases in May and the highest death toll to be in Europe. This is
            hugely disappointing since the UK had a huge warning from the WHO
            that they were 3 weeks behind Italy, and yet I distinctly remember
            being told nothing would happen, to simply wash my hands for 20
            seconds, and our prime minister, Boris Johnson, not taking it so
            seriously. Italy managed to keep the death toll lower than the UK
            and had no warning that they would be hit with the virus, yet the UK
            delayed lockdowns and ran out of PPE for the NHS staff. Experts say
            that the UK went into lockdown 2 weeks earlier when the death toll
            could have been halved.
