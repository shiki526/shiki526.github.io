      <p class="makecenter">All lives matter  <br>
         Not only black lives.  <br>
         I mean, no one actually said  <br> 
         “ONLY Black Lives Matter”, <br>
         But I still think  <br>
         “Black Lives Matter” is a quite racist phrase.  <br>
         It’s almost as if  <br>
         They are trying to tell me  <br>
         That my white life doesn’t matter.  <br>
         That chant purposely excludes all other races.  <br>
         Doesn’t everyone’s life matter?  <br>
         Shouldn’t we be fighting for all lives?  <br>
      </p> 
     </div>
     <div class="row">
        <p class="makecenter"> 
            Black men and women aren’t the only ones who suffer <br>
            From oppression. <br>
            White people get called “crackers” <br>
            White people get bullied for supporting Trump <br>
            White people face police brutality as well. <br>
            Although, the police brutality we face <br>
            Isn't racially charged, <br>
            And we don’t have to suffer <br>
            Nearly as much unnecessary force <br>
            At the hands of a police officer <br>
            Than a black man or women would, <br>
            It doesn’t matter! <br>
            Isn’t that still enough to show <br>
            that not only “Black Lives Matter”?<br>
            Shouldn’t we be fighting for all lives?<br>

            My brother is a cop <br>
            He would never threaten a Black man<br>
            Based on the color of his skin.  <br>
            There is no evidence to prove that Black men and women <br>
            Are racially oppressed day to day. . <br>
            and highly evidential inequalities that still exist...  <br>
            But let's forget about that. <br>
            Statistics don’t actually mean anything<br>
            They are just numbers on paper  <br>
            What am I supposed to do about it? <br>
            Shouldn't we be fighting for all lives? <br>

        <p class="makecenter"> 
            “Black Lives Matter”,  <br>
            The chant that spews like roaring water<br>
            Through the cities that us true American’s live, <br>
            Is the farthest thing from actually being American.  <br>
            Although these protesters are demonstrating  <br>
            Their First Amendment rights,  <br>
            They don’t get to use those rights  <br>
            If what they are preaching <br>
            Is that “Black Lives Matter!”.  <br>
            White people’s labor and hard work<br>
            Is what entirely built this country <br>
            And that should not be disrespected. <br>
            Only white people are allowed <br>
            To run to our state’s capital <br>
            With guns strapped to our bodies <br>
            Shoving them in police officers' faces. <br>
            How do we get away with it? <br>
            Well, if you must know, <br>
            It's because we're white <br>
            Oh. <br>
            We get away with it because of the color of our skin. <br>
            Well damn...<br>
            If that's the case<br>
            Then I might just have to re-write the whole poem <br>
