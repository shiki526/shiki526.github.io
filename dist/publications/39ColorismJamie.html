            Colorism: The Colonization of Beauty

            <div class="row">
                <i style="text-indent: 50px;">“I am black, but comely, O ye daughters of Jerusalem, as the tents of Kedar, as the curtains of Solomon. Look not upon
                me, because I am black, because the sun hath looked upon me...” (Song of Songs 1: 5-6)</i>
                <p style="text-indent: 50px;">
                    In this famous passage from Song of Songs, a certain phrase in the English translation alludes to a deep-rooted
                    intersection of color and beauty. It’s no surprise that colorism has become interwoven in everyday society; it’s a
                    concept as old as the holy books. However, in the original Hebrew text, “I am black, but comely” reads instead as “I am
                    black, and comely.” This slight alteration in wording makes a world of difference: Black isn’t sinful or unattractive,
                    it’s an unabashed statement of beauty. So then, why is it that Western societies choose to embed colorism into religion?
                    In regards to the constant shift of societal standards, trends are and have always been defined by “whiteness”.
                </p>
                <p style="text-indent: 50px;">
                    The global audience has always shown favoritism towards lighter-skin— it’s ignorant to think that colorism is exclusive
                    to the U.S. In many countries, colorism has disguised itself as an aspect of culture. South Korea’s evergrowing K-pop
                    industry produces idols that the people adore not only for their music and artistry, but also for their faces of
                    ideality and whitewashed skin. Asia as a whole has always valued pale skin. Today, colorism has seamlessly been fostered
                    by children’s fairy tales— princesses and goddesses almost always have snow-white skin. It’s treated as a symbol of
                    purity, which then became an aspect of beauty. Girls on the streets are covered up head-to-toe to preserve their
                    “beauty”— large-brimmed hats, doused in sunscreen, parasols, fingerless gloves that climb up forearms. In recent years,
                    as an effort to diversify beauty, people from many countries have begun moving away from the idolization of eurocentric
                    features to embrace darker skin tones. However, one thing has been made clear— these countries have all been spoon-fed a
                    dose of anti-Blackness.
                </p>
                <p style="text-indent: 50px;">
                    While many attach modern-day colorism to centuries of colonialism, Asia’s obsession with complexion was established long
                    before colonizers. Color was equivalent to class— only the wealthiest had the luxury of staying indoors, away from the
                    sun.
                </p>
                <p style="text-indent: 50px;">
                    Bollywood’s fixation on light complexions has also perpetuated instances of brownface in the industry. According to NBC
                    News, colorism in India predates Bollywood— rather, the movie industry’s attitude towards fair skin is only a symptom.
                    Long before the arrival of British colonists, India’s casteism was built on what we now consider colorism— lower castes
                    were dark and “ugly” from laboring in the sun, while higher castes were fair from lack of toil. Although the caste
                    system has technically been abandoned, it still exists in subtle ways, such as colorism in the Bollywood industry. The
                    2019 film, Bala, depicted a dark-skinned woman’s struggles facing discrimination in Indian society. Ironically, the
                    woman was played by Bhumi Pednekar, a light-skinned actress who needed to darken her skin for the role. The film
                    received backlash, but it isn’t uncommon for fair-skinned actors in brownface to portray characters from destitute
                    backgrounds— it’s going to take time to dismantle anti-darkness. Unfortunately, ancient concepts aren’t easy to uproot.
                </p>
                <p style="text-indent: 50px;">
                    The U.S. was founded on similar ideologies of colonialism and class, which has shaped the way colorism plays out in
                    American society.

                        “Now if you was white, should be all right
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If you was brown, could stick around
                    </p>
                    <p>

                <p style="text-indent: 50px;">
                    The aforementioned text is a passage from Big Bill Broonzy’s Black, Brown and White, a protest song in the 20th century
                    that captures the definition of American colorism. As a country that isn’t nearly as monoethnic as those in Asia, color
                    is charged with racial stereotypes. Outside the U.S., the value of fair skin links to culture and history deeply
                    entangled with Western colonization. However, the United States never had a culture of colorism before European
                    colonizers. The entire country’s foundation is centered around Western ideals and ultimately, white supremacy. As the
                    slave trade peaked in the 18th century, colorism became common practice— while darker-skinned slaves labored as field
                    hands, light-skinned slaves were favored and usually worked indoors.
                </p>
                <p style="text-indent: 50px;">
                    Similar antebellum attitudes decriminalized rape on the basis of a victim’s race. Court cases were overturned simply
                    because the victim wasn’t White. As noted by Jeffrey Pokorak, a professor at Suffolk University, white men were able to
                    to justify sexual assault of the “caste inferior” using a “two-pronged criminal law response to Black sexuality”: Black
                    women could not be raped because of their “temptress” natures, while Black men were “lascivious,” and all rapists. At
                    that time, mixed-raced children were often a result of sexual assault. Although they would never be recognized as
                    legitimate, their lightness and white ancestry were considered “privileges” and assets. A history deeply intertwined
                    with the legalization of racial oppression would leave indefinite scars on the nation.
                </p>
                <p style="text-indent: 50px;">
                    Even after slavery had long been abolished, discrimination still persisted. Anti-Blackness had been instilled into
                    society and many in the Black community felt as though the fallacious association between whiteness and privilege was
                    inescapable. In the early 1900s, jazz culture rose to popularity in New York City, but it wasn’t the only thing that
                    took the city by storm. As reported by Daily News, the all-white customers who frequented jazz clubs enjoyed the music
                    as much as they did the Copper-Colored Gals, a group of dancers who performed in the well-known Cotton Club. Young
                    female performers hoping to join needed to meet certain criteria set by the club’s owners— along with being talented and
                    attractive, their skin had to be lighter than a brown paper bag. As a result, the ignition of routine paper bag tests
                    became responsible for anti-blackness within the Black community. Upper-class members of Black society were often
                    light-skinned and performed the bag test on darker-skinned Black people as if lightness was equivalent to worthiness.
                </p>
                <p style="text-indent: 50px;">
                    In the 1920s, this insidious premium on fairness began to fade. While those in Europe’s upper class had always valorized
                    fairness (going as far as applying toxic whitening concoctions on their skin, a millennia-old practice), fairness fell
                    out of favor at the turn of the industrial revolution. Accordingly, factory work occupied western Europe and “the
                    working classes had moved into the shadows.” With smog from factories constantly in the air, barely any time was spent
                    outdoors in the sun. Tan skin was cemented as the West’s new “beautiful” when fashion icon Coco Chanel was photographed
                    sun-kissed on her Meditteranean vacation, and at the time, anything Chanel did became a trend.
                </p>
                <p style="text-indent: 50px;">
                    Growing up in America today, tan skin is worn with pride— a symbol of history-rich culture and beauty. However, in many
                    industries, melanin is still largely underrepresented and discriminated against—

                    Hadid has Palestinian heritage, her white-passing appearance has no doubt benefited her.
                    In 2018, model Gigi Hadid received backlash for her Vogue Italia cover, where she appeared to be heavily tanned. While

                    As stated in Paper Magazine, in the fashion industry, haute couture shoots like this aren’t supposed to portray
                    conventionality; to an audience centered in eurocentric beauty standards, the models could be perceived as “exotic”— as
                    if anything that doesn’t follow eurocentricity is the “other”. But Brown skin isn’t supposed to be stylized. Fault
                    doesn’t lay in Hadid or in this specific shoot— the entire beauty industry is fueled by subconscious undertones of
                    colorism. Vogue Italia Editor Patti Wilson, herself a Black woman, defended Hadid’s cover, which she had directed: “Gigi
                    was meant to look bronze, tan, and gorgeous.” However, there are actual POC models who could fit the “bronze, tan, and
                    gorgeous” image required for the cover shoot.

                    Melanin is only seen as beautiful when it’s worn by white bodies. The same melanin that got Breonna Taylor murdered in
                    her own home. It’s the same melanin that compels Walmart to exclusively lock up African-American hair products because
                    of stereotypes. Melanin, which has ingrained a sense of inferiority within POC, has become an assertion of privilege for
                    white people.
                </p>
                <p style="text-indent: 50px;">
                    As unfair as it is, it’s unreasonable to expect a definite end to colorism, at least not anytime soon. The fight needs
                    to begin within— question your own mindset. Does skin tone affect your perception of others? Of yourself? Is color just
                    color, or does it represent something else?
