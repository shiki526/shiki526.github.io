          <h3>
            1. Could you please tell us about yourself and introduce GenZ Girl
            Gang?
          </h3>
          <p>
            My name is Sequoia Smith, and I&rsquo;m the Directory of Advocacy
            and Communications at GenZ Girl Gang. I graduated from Mount Saint
            Mary&rsquo;s University in Los Angeles, California. I majored in
            Political Science and minored in Pre-law in the hope of going to law
            school and becoming a criminal defense attorney. <br>
            GenZ Girl Gang is a bold experiment in the way we use social media
            as a community-building tool. We challenge the basic features of
            Instagram to build deeper connections and provide resources to our
            community members on how they can support each other and redefine
            sisterhood in the age of social media and infinite connection.

        <div class="row">
          <h3>
            2. You mentioned that GGG is a bold experiment with a mission to
            redefine sisterhood. What does the &ldquo;bold&rdquo; mean to you?
            What does &ldquo;sisterhood&rdquo; mean to you?
          </h3>
          <p>
            To us bold means not being afraid of stepping out of the boundaries
            that society places us in. GenZ Girl Gang uses a whole new framework
            of how we connect to our audience and build community with them.<br>
            Sisterhood to us means community. Your community are the people who
            show up for you no matter what, cheer you on and support you in your
            endeavors but at the same time hold you accountable when you mess
            up.

            3. In your opinion, what are the biggest issues Generation Z girls
            face today?
          </h3>
          <p>
            I think our generation is struggling with many issues whether that
            be affordable housing, student debt, a living wage, gun violence,
            etc. but I think the biggest issue is climate change. If we do not
            take swift action to slow climate change down, it will not matter if
            we have affordable housing or end gun violence since there will be
            no planet to live on.

            4. How do you see sisterhood being misrepresented? Why is it
            important to redefine sisterhood?
          </h3>
          <p>
            Its not that sisterhood is misrepresented, GenZ Girl Gang wanted to
            redefine sisterhood by rooting it in community-building. We think
            it&rsquo;s important to root sisterhood in community because
            community is the lifeline for every strong woman and femme.

            5. Why do you think it is important to empower women through
            community building?
          </h3>
          <p>
            At GenZ Girl Gang, we believe community building is the best way to
            empower women because it fosters an environment of collaboration
            over competition. We strongly believe that it is important for women
            and femmes to work together instead of working against each other.
            When women treat each other as collaborators instead of competition
            innovation is allowed to take hold.

            6. Tell us about the past campaigns at Genz Girl Gang. How has it
            helped bridge generational gaps and create a network of sisterhood?
            What resources do they offer to girls?
          </h3>
          <p>
            This past year, GenZ Girl Gang&rsquo;s three seasonal campaigns;
            Demand and Disrupt, College Access for All, and Pitch, Please! have
            served our members directly. The Demand and Disruptcampaign taught
            community members skills to advocate for their needs and disrupt
            traditional views of professionalism in the workplace, resulting in
            this Teen Vogue feature. GenZ Girl Gang&rsquo;s College Access for
            All campaign used Instagram&rsquo;s chat feature to connect ninety
            high school juniors and seniors to mentorship from current college
            students and brought to life an in-person event n inclusivity in
            higher education in partnership with Samsung 837. Most recently,
            GenZ Girl Gang has been exploring how to celebrate platonic love,
            hype up ourselves and our friends, and build power in our personal
            networks through the Pitch, Please campaign.

          <p>
            We created our community coalition to share resources, uplift other

            9. What vision does GenZ Girl Gang have for sisterhood in the
            future?
          </h3>
          <p>
            Our vision at GenZ Girl Gang is to build the next generation of
            leaders through sisterhood. So often, women and femmes are taught
            there can only be one seat at the table that we must compete with
            each other for, but our generation won't settle for a seat at the
            table. We are creating our own. We&rsquo;re taking steps today to
            build a future where congresswomen, astronauts, entrepreneurs, those
            who will hold jobs that we cannot even imagine yet are connected in
            interdisciplinary personal networks. It&rsquo;s this
            relationship-building that will empower us to take on the challenges
            of tomorrow with a deeper understanding and from new perspectives.

            10. What advice do you have for girls who want to become a
            self-advocate?
          </h3>
          <p>
            I don&rsquo;t know if I have any specific advice for that because
            I&rsquo;m still very much learning how to advocate for myself, but
            what I will say is do not be afraid to tell people what you need
            from them to be successful. If you need help with something, ask.
            The majority of people want to help you even if you do not know
            them.

            11. With all the injustice that has been happening in our current
            social climate, how has GenZ Girl Gang been raising awareness of
            systematic racism in this country and actively creating space for
            black women and girls?
          </h3>
          <p>
            We have paused all of our normal content and have shifted to a more
            racial justice focus. We have been putting our protest safety
            guides, amplifying black voices, and educating people on their
            constitutional rights.
