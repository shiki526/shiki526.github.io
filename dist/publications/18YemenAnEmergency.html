        Yemen: An Emergency within an Emergency

            In Yemen, the integrated impact of more than 5 years of
            socio-political conflict between the Hadi-led Yemeni government and
            Houthi armed movement, economic decline, and institutional collapse
            has left 24 million people – about two-thirds of the population – in
            need of humanitarian aid and protection.This long-running conflict
            involves Houthi rebels (aligned with the former President Saleh) and
            a pro-government institution supported by a military coalition led
            by Saudi Arabia and UAE.

            The crisis has reached cataclysmic proportions, and with COVID-19
            exacerbating living conditions and spreading cross-country,
            sanitation and clean water are in short supply. Furthermore, with a
            famine threatening thousands of lives and thousands of children
            suffering from malnutrition, Yemen requires the utmost attention of
            younger masses, in terms of donations, petitions, and spreading the
            word. Ideally, countries and their governments should be pushing
            lucrative legislation, monetary and humanitarian assistance, as well
            as mediate the considered conflict. However, inaction by a majority
            of states is evident: to shed light on these atrocities and
            highlight youth voices pushing for tangible action, the
            aforementioned tasks, in addition to being accurately informed can
            go a long way.

            As a result, UNICEF has declared Yemen’s ongoing dissension as the
            world’s largest humanitarian crisis. Ignorance is the stagnation of
            innovative solutions, which is why recognizing and working towards
            alleviating Yemen’s humanitarian crisis through social media
            activism, online articles, and word of mouth is of utmost
            importance. Specifically considering social media, it can be a
            vessel to transform knowledge into tangible action: sharing accurate
            information, linking petitions, donations and valid newsreels can
            help educate, empathize and create opportunities for the youth to
            strive for social justice. Often, constant exposure to news on
            social media allows individuals to take the conversation beyond an
            app, into the confines of their home and communities, especially if
            the issue has not been addressed in the media. Sadly, the Yemen
            crisis does not get NEARLY enough media coverage that it deserves,
            as #BlackLivesMatter is a current focal point (as it should be, but
            we need to prioritize Yemen too). Therefore, please read the
            following article and inform yourselves: and do your part in
            donating, and sharing accurate information over social media.

          <h3>10 Facts You Need to Know:</h3>
          <p>
            1. The humanitarian situation is still the worst in the world, with
            24 million people in need of assistance.
          </p>
          <p>
            2. Every 10 minutes, a child under the age of 5 dies of preventable
            causes.
          </p>
          <p>3. Approximately 3 million people have been displaced.</p>
          <p>
            4. Around 18 million Yemenis don’t have access to safe drinking
            water and cases of cholera have surged.
          </p>
          <p>
            5. Humanitarian response faces a funding gap of nearly 2 million
            dollars.
          </p>
          <p>
            6. The conflict has resulted in the deaths of more than 100,000
            people, including over 20,000 civilians, and has forced 3.65 million
            people to flee.
          </p>
          <p>
            7. In 21 days (tracking from 19th June) Yemen will run out of oil, a
            necessity for basic household activities and a major export
            commodity. A majority of underfunded hospitals will shut down, and
            there will be a scarcity of clean water.
          </p>
          <p>
            In 111 days (tracking from 19th June), Yemen will run out of rice

          <p>
            9. In the past 15 minutes, a child in Yemen passed away. Another
            child will die in the next 15, and another after that, and after
            that.
