            Beyond the Black Square: The Problem With Performative Activism
            <div class="divider"></div>
            <div class="author">By: Dorothy Chan</div>
        </div>

        <div class="textBlock page-section">
            <div class="row">
                <p>When George Floyd was tragically murdered at the hands of now-former police officers Derek Chauvin, Tou Thao, Alexander
                Kueng, and Thomas Lane on May 25, 2020, people were forced to reconsider racial issues in America. Thousands of
                protesters marched in the streets of Minneapolis, the city where Floyd lived and was murdered by police. These protests
                quickly spread through the rest of the nation and across the globe as a collective act of solidarity for George Floyd
                and countless other victims of police brutality. These protests later became associated with the larger Black Lives
                Matter movement that started in 2013.</p>
                <p>As a result of police brutality being brought to the forefront of national attention, there was a distinct shift in the
                type of content being circulated around social media platforms. Posts providing links to petitions and charities were
                shared in mass quantities, replacing the usual images of dogs and poorly lit selfies. During this period, people were
                more vocal than ever about social justice issues; it was the peak of digital activism.</p>
                <p>Suddenly, on June 2, 2020, a flood of black squares accompanied by the caption #blackouttuesday took social media by
                storm.</p>
                <p>Blackout Tuesday, an organized event that sparked an abrupt change in our feeds, stemmed from #TheShowMustBeStopped, an
                initiative created by music executives Brianna Agyemang and Jamila Thomas, who recognized that Black artists have been
                historically disadvantaged because of their race– from producers discrediting their work to refusing to acknowledge the
                impact that Black culture has had on the music and entertainment industry. #TheShowMustBeStopped strived to encourage
                its participants to refrain from releasing new music and cease business.</p>
                <p>Spotify and Apple Music, for example, curated playlists entirely composed of songs written by Black artists and added an
                8:46-minute moment of silence on certain playlists, the amount of time that Derek Chauvin had kneeled on George Floyd’s
                neck. Other music companies, such as Universal Music Group and Sony, pledged $25 million and $100 million, respectively,
                to support anti-racist efforts in the music industry and general population.</p>
                <p>As the movement became more mainstream amongst the youth, many were encouraged to use Blackout Tuesday as an opportunity
                to reflect on the recent events and America’s history with the Black Lives Matter movement. Participants were encouraged
                to silence their voices to show their solidarity with the Black Lives Matter movement by posting black squares on their
                feeds with the caption #blackouttuesday. While the cause may have been well-intended, the execution of Blackout Tuesday
                inadvertently stunted the progress of the movement. The silence was meant to disrupt feeds, yet it ended up muting the
                movement completely by drowning out important resources through the misuse of the #BlackLivesMatter hashtag and
                overwhelming our screens with nothing but black tiles.</p>
                <p>Blackout Tuesday was a collective act of performative activism. Individuals demonstrated a sense of concern towards
                prominent issues for the sake of their media presence, as opposed to bringing attention to the cause itself. This, while
                arguably being more effective than doing nothing at all, does not beneficially contribute to the movement if you
                ultimately do not care. When you share an infographic that has been spreading within your group of followers without
                reading it just to promote your own agenda of being anti-racist and socially well-informed, consider the lengths that
                you’re willing to go to take advantage of the issues in our society to demonstrate how compassionate and educated you
                are.</p>
                <p>Black Lives Matter is not a trend that you can use to your advantage to build up your social capital. An infographic on
                your Instagram story should not be used as a shield to prevent backlash when you decide that a picture of your breakfast
                was more worthy to share than an infographic with information on bail funds and hotlines. Even if you had good
                intentions, your “allyship” is meaningless if the impact you caused is anything but actively supporting and advocating
                for the issue at hand.</p>
                <p>Similarly to when Instagram users changed their profile pictures to blue for #BlueforSudan, which was started in
                solidarity with protests in the wake of the death of Mohamed Hashim Mattar, or when Facebook users used a filter of a
                French flag over their profile pictures for #PrayforParis in an attempt to sympathize with those affected by the
                terrorist attacks in Paris, the extent to which people cared about Black Lives Matter was demonstrated through their
                token black square and absence of financial, social, and political support.</p>
                <p>This is the boundary that separates performative and authentic allyship.</p>
                <p>Behind each repost on your Instagram story is a real issue where people are suffering, being oppressed, or fighting for
                their lives. They deserve more than the two minutes it takes for you to repost the story. They deserve more than just 24
                hours of attention.</p>
                <p>Nevertheless, while having a platform allows you to spread awareness on important issues, you are still entitled to what
                you post on your own account. Regardless, it is also your responsibility to consider the moral obligation that comes
                from this privilege and the effects that result from it.</p>
                <p>While utilizing social media platforms is known to be an effective and popular way to participate in activism, it is not
                necessarily essential to address important issues. Your actions matter as much offline as they do online, if not more.
                Signing petitions, protesting, and educating yourself is just as important as sharing a post on Instagram.</p>
                <p>With the elections coming up in a few months, one of the most important things you can do as an ally for racial equality
                is to vote– specifically for a candidate that shares the same anti-racist goals as you. After all, posting a black
                square is inconsequential to voting for an official that can enact federal change to the most significant contributor to
                racism– institutions. It is counterproductive to vote for someone who is against the policies that you advocate for.</p>
                <p>Continue being active in the fights against social injustices. Even if you are only able to sign petitions, continue to
                do so– even if you think they won’t make an impact, because they do. Elijah McCain’s case was reopened after his
                petition gained over 2 million signatures. Trayvon Martin’s murderer was charged with second-degree murder after his
                petition gained over 2.2 million signatures. Donate to bail funds for protestors or call your local representatives if
                you can. Continue the fight for those who have not earned justice yet.</p>
                <p>Make the effort to prove your allyship beyond your hyperactive Instagram page. But to do so, ask yourself this first:</p>
                <p class="italic">
                    When will you stop hiding behind the shield of your black square and start actively fighting against the issues at hand?
