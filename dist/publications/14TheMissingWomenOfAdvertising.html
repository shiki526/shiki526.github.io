        The Missing Women Of Advertising
        <div class="dividerpub"></div>
        <h3 class="author">By: Barnana Hemoprava Sarkar</h3>
      </div>

      <div class="textBlock page-section">

          <p>
            The one aspect that sets advertising apart from any other creative
            form is its purpose. To sell a product to someone who doesn’t want
            to buy it. That is the simple part. The difficulty arrives when you
            sit to decide on ‘how to’. Most cosmetic brands seem to have cracked
            the code. As harsh as it may sound the brands and their
            advertisements feed on a woman’s insecurities. Right from the days
            when Madison Avenue’s sparkling billboards displayed a pretty
            red-lipped blonde, the perfect epitome of womanhood, little has
            changed over the course of time.

            Although sincere attempts are being made by brands such as Dove,
            which took the initiative to include women - the “Real Women” - of
            every kind. Some brands have also tried to expand their palette to
            be more inclusive about skin colour. Rihanna’s Fenty Beauty gave the
            industry a massive blow when it launched 40 different shades of
            foundation. It not only shook the traditional notions of beauty but
            opened up a whole platform for all the consumers who have so far
            felt underserved by the giant cosmetic brands.

            Yet, there seems to be a significant absence of those women who till
            today are the subjects of several discussions. The transwomen are
            constantly not included in the narrative when it comes to
            advertising for these beauty brands. But they form a significant
            portion of the consumer group, all the while constantly fighting
            against the concept that only external appearance can define who a
            real woman is. The concept of this real woman has been so concocted
            by beauty brands that several trans women feel a very superimposed
            need to use makeup.

          <p>
            Of course, there are the Pride Month quotas that most brands
            diligently participate in but it is important to ask: is that
            enough?
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="row">
          <p>
            There are some visibly sincere attempts that showcase the real
            struggles of a trans woman and how gracefully she overcomes all of
            it. One of the most successful stories we have come across recently
            is Vicks’ ad (although not a beauty brand) titled ‘Touch of Care’
            which deals with two significant subjects - adoption and transgender
            rights. The ad perfectly captured the real-life story of Gauri
            Sawant, who became the first transgender person in 2014 to file a
            petition in the Supreme Court for the adoption rights of transgender
            people. Told from the perspective of her adopted daughter, Gayatri,
            the ad has put a benchmark about what representation should look
            like. For, while Vicks got it right, several are still staggering in
            the process of ideal story-telling.

          <h3 class="makecenter">Reliance On Tokenism</h3>
        </div>
        <div class="row">
          <p>
            For decades the trans community remained invisible for brands.
            However, with the recent revelation that the queer community’s total
            buying power can be something as close to $917 million brands are
            trying to put things out there as much as they can. They are
            creating exclusive issues and campaigns that only highlight queer
            people and talk about the community at large during the Pride Month.
            Sadly, that is not quite doing the work. In fact, it is nothing but
            sheer tokenism.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="row">
          <p>
            While some beauty brands, such as Ciaté London, MAC and Sleek MakeUP
            have tapped on transgender models for their campaigns, it is
            important to ask how much research and work has been put into
            developing the products that suit the transgender community. “Makeup
            products are not researched or developed keeping transgender people
            in mind. Earlier the problem was that the developer of a woman’s
            cosmetic product was a man and then with the women’s movements, that
            gradually changed. The same thing needs to happen with the
            transgender people as well. You have to include people from the
            community in the research and developing sector.”

          <h3 class="makecenter">Inside The Conference Room</h3>
        </div>
        <div class="row">
          <p>
            While several people will claim that there are many ads today
            representing the community, it cannot be denied that these brands
            have failed to maintain the true aspect of inclusion. Brands have
            managed to sensationalise the subject to a point where they “look
            good” to the generation that cares about everyone’s rights. However,
            when it comes to actually hiring a person from the community, there
            is a large vacuum in the conference room that decides upon the
            narrative of these brands.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="row">
          <p>
            There can be two reasons behind it. Firstly, there is a
            stereotypical notion that trans people mostly pick up acting or
            modelling as their go-to profession. This results in the common
            practice of commodifying the trans woman’s body for either tokenism
            or a “checkbox” for brands to put a tick on. Secondly, the
            conference room continues to remain a heavily male-dominated space.
            Doel Rakshit, a copywriter and activist based out of Mumbai, said,
            “Till today creating narrative is a very cis-male thing. A woman,
            even a cis-woman, or any marginalized gender ideating and processing
            narratives for brand stories is not something equally applauded.”
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="row">
          <p>
            The problem with change is that sometimes it is too unorganised.
            While ads are trying to bring in a new narrative, it is unclear if
            that is simply a trend they are following or if it is actually
            something that will sustain. There is also a lack of data when it
            comes to identifying the community. Kiran Khalap, co-founder of
            Chlorophyll brand consultancy, pointed out, “Advertising in general
            lags behind society when it comes to change. There has to be
            representatives who make the industry conscious about its
            unconscious biases.”
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="row">
          <p>
            In order to make industries aware of the kind of consumers they are
            dealing with there has to be a regular update of census data. With a
            conscious generation that is constantly inclining towards gender
            fluidity and a whole community of people who are fighting every
            single day for their rights, a properly structured data can
            certainly put an end to the age-old question of, “how many people
            are actually in this community?” Put them all together and maybe it
            will be realised that they constitute a greater percentage of the
            population.
          </p>

        <div class="row">
          <p>
            Advertising is a powerful source of communication. Sometimes even
            more powerful than films. In order to sell something it convinces
            people into believing something they do not believe in. That can be
            a very significant move when it comes to creating awareness about
            the rights of trans women - if done right. It is needless to point
            out the obvious fact that recently, especially after JK Rowling’s
            infamous rant about the transgender community, there is a need to
            address the issues of trans women more than ever. And advertising
            has the capability to do just that.
