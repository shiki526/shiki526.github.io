        Thousands of Tons of Oil Flood the Southern Edge of the Arctic Circle
        <div class="dividerpub"></div>

            In the midst of the pandemic and the protests demanding racial
            equality which erupted after George Floyd’s death, public attention
            has been drawn towards these main focal points and has hardly been
            on much else. Regardless, one area that demands the attention of the
            public is the current situation in Russia.
          </p>

        <div class="row">
          <p>
            On May 29, a power plant leaked several thousand tons of oil into
            the river around Norilsk, causing the city to declare a state of
            emergency. Norilsk is a Russian city in the country’s Siberan
            region, located at the very edge on the Arctic Circle. The Ambarnaya
            and Daldykan rivers, which is located just to the west of the city,
            flooded with about 21,000 tons of oil when a fuel tank at the
            Norilsk Nickel power plant collapsed.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="row">
          <p>
            Jarring footage has been released of the Ambarnaya river bleeding a
            deep shade of red as the oil spreads for kilometers across its
            surface.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="row">
          <p>
            Norilsk Nickel, the company that owns the plant, chalked the
            collapse up to being caused by climate change and the thawing
            permafrost which made the ground underneath the tank to become too
            soft to support its weight, as is the case for a not insignificant
            number of buildings in towns in the surrounding area. Further
            investigations however, have called that statement into question.
            This is likely due to the fact that the Russian government was only
            notified about the incident two days after it occurred.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="row">
          <p>
            It has come to public attention that the container being used to
            store the oil had not been cleared for use because it did not “fully
            conform to the demands of industrial safety,” as stated by the
            country’s investigative committee spokesperson, Svetlana Petrenko.
            Due to the disregard for environmental protection laws, three people
            involved in the incident, two engineers and the plant’s director,
            have since been fired.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="row">
          <p>
            Currently, the oil seems to be moving north with the flow of the
            river, towards Lake Pyasino. Booms have been used to stop the spread
            of some of the oil while pumps remove it and store it in containers,
            only having resulted in the cleanup of less than 500 tons of oil.
            Despite the attempts of Norilsk Nickel to clean up their mess, the
            harm has already been done.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="row">
          <p>
            Due to clean up and water reparation alone, the estimated cost of
            this monumental mishap is seeming to be around $85 million
            conservatively.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="row">
          <p>
            There are also significant consequences from a purely ecological
            standpoint as well. Greenpeace has dubbed this the first incident of
            such a large degree in the Arctic region.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="row">
          <p>
            The Russian deputy minister of national resources and the
            environment, Elena Panova, has estimated that it could take about 10
            years for the environment to recover. While the deaths of fish,
            birds and other wildlife in the area are some of the immediate
            outcomes of the spill, the toxins in the ecosystem can affect
            populations for generations to come.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="row">
          <p>
            Cleaning the oil out completely with the use of sorbents is a
            process that can take several years by itself.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="row">
          <p>
            It goes without saying that the preliminary timeline of 10 years is
            just an estimate and that, when it comes to environmental matters,
            there are a myriad of unknown factors that can alter these types of
            approximations.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="row">
          <p>
            The damaging effects of an oil spill aren’t limited to harming the
            surrounding wildlife. The spread of oil across a body of water can
            also have significant impacts on climate change and the warming of
            the planet which affects everyone.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="row">
          <p>
            The thin layer of oil that rests atop the affected water can do a
            surprising amount when it comes to warming the planet. The oil
            significantly decreases the amount of heat that is allowed to escape
            the water by means of evaporation. Instead, the overall temperature
            of the water warms. When the oil kills plant and animal life, it
            also lessens the amount of carbon that is able to be captured,
            halting the flow of the carbon cycle.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="row">
          <p>
            All of the harmful effects of both oil spills and the burning of
            fossil fuels prove that the use of oil instead of renewable energy
            sources poses a myriad of negative environmental impacts which far
            outweigh the benefits.
          </p>

            It is difficult for the concerned public to keep track of exactly
            how much the story has progressed, due to several contributing
            factors. The impact that the coronavirus and social distancing and
            quarantine measures have had on the ability of people who work both
            for government and environmental agencies to do their jobs
            effectively has been incredibly evident. However, the media’s
            inability to go forth and get information for the same reasons,
            paired with their reluctance to cover a story that may not be as
            interesting to viewers has severely debilitated the public’s ability
            to know about what is happening in the world which is incredibly
            dangerous, especially when the information that they are missing
            pertains to environmental concerns.
